# Section Reorganization Ideas

## Current State

**Articles** is now in the navigation! 🎉

### Current Sections (12 total):
1. **History** - Long-form history essays
2. **Articles** - ✨ NEW - Guides, features, lists, etc.
3. **Events** - Upcoming events
4. **Scenes** - Photos/videos with filters
5. **Coffee Shops** - Best coffee shops
6. **Bars** - Best bars
7. **Restaurants** - Best restaurants
8. **Local Favorites** - Iconic spots everyone knows
9. **Hidden Gems** - Lesser-known spots
10. **Dark History** - Dark/macabre history
11. **Lost & Loved** - Closed/gone businesses
12. **Curiosities** - Interesting facts

## The Problem

You're right - **many of these could just be articles**. For example:
- "Best Coffee Shops" → Could be an article
- "Hidden Gems" → Could be an article
- "Best Bars" → Could be an article

The current structure creates:
- Too many sections (overwhelming)
- Duplicate content types (some are lists, some are guides)
- Hard to find stuff (12 sections to navigate)

## Reorganization Ideas

### Option 1: Content Type Focused

**Featured Sections (Always Visible):**
- **History** - Long-form essays (premium scrollytelling)
- **Articles** - All publishable content (guides, features, lists)
- **Events** - Time-sensitive events
- **Scenes** - Photo/video gallery

**Everything Else Becomes Articles:**
- Coffee shops → Article category "Best Of"
- Bars → Article category "Best Of"
- Restaurants → Article category "Best Of"
- Hidden Gems → Article category "Hidden Gems"
- Dark History → Article category "Dark History"
- Lost & Loved → Article category "Lost & Loved"
- Curiosities → Could be article category OR keep as interactive scrolling experience

**Result:** 4 main sections + Articles with categories

---

### Option 2: Experience Focused

**Discover (Interactive):**
- **Curiosities** - Scrolling fun facts (keep as-is, it's unique)
- **Dark History** - Scrolling dark stories (keep premium experience)
- **Scenes** - Photo gallery with filters
- **Events** - Calendar view

**Read (Articles):**
- **Articles** - All written content
  - Categories: Guides, Features, Best Of, Hidden Gems, History, Lost & Loved

**Result:** Split between "Discover" (interactive/visual) and "Read" (written content)

---

### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Main Navigation (4-5 sections):**
1. **Overview** - City homepage (what is now "History" landing)
2. **Articles** - All written content with categories
3. **Discover** - Interactive experiences (Curiosities, Dark History, Scenes)
4. **Events** - Upcoming events
5. **Guide** - Best Of lists (Bars, Restaurants, Coffee, Hidden Gems)

**Article Categories (filterable in Articles section):**
- Features
- Guides
- History
- Dark History
- Lost & Loved
- Best Of
- Hidden Gems
- Local Culture

**Discover Section (unique interactive experiences):**
- Curiosities (scrolling facts)
- Dark History (scrolling stories with premium animations)
- Scenes (photo gallery)

**Guide Section (curated lists):**
- Best Bars
- Best Restaurants
- Best Coffee Shops
- Hidden Gems
- Local Favorites (iconic spots)

**Result:** Cleaner navigation, but preserves unique experiences

## What Makes Sense as an Article vs. a Section?

### Should Be Articles:
✅ **Written content** - Guides, features, histories, lists
✅ **One-time publishable** - Write once, evergreen content
✅ **SEO-focused** - Want to rank in Google
✅ **Sharable** - People share individual pieces

Examples:
- "Best New Restaurants in 2025"
- "10 Hidden Gems for Winter"
- "The History of Mill City"
- "Lost Bars We Miss"

### Should Be Sections:
✅ **Interactive experiences** - Scrolling, galleries, filters
✅ **Continuously updated** - Events calendar, photo galleries
✅ **Unique UX** - Requires special components/interactions
✅ **Browse-focused** - People explore, not read linearly

Examples:
- Curiosities (scrolling with animations)
- Events (calendar + filters)
- Scenes (photo gallery)
- Dark History (premium scrollytelling)

## My Recommendation

### Simplified Structure (5 main sections):

1. **Overview** (`/minneapolis`)
   - City intro, recent articles, what's new
   - Gateway to everything else

2. **Articles** (`/minneapolis/articles`)
   - All written content
   - Filterable by category (Guides, Features, Best Of, History, etc.)
   - This becomes your content publishing hub

3. **Experiences** (`/minneapolis/experiences`)
   - Curiosities (scrolling facts)
   - Dark History (scrolling stories)
   - Scenes (photo gallery)
   - Interactive, visual content

4. **Events** (`/minneapolis/events`)
   - Upcoming events with calendar
   - Keep as-is

5. **Guide** (`/minneapolis/guide`)
   - Best Bars (curated list)
   - Best Restaurants (curated list)
   - Best Coffee (curated list)
   - Hidden Gems (curated list)
   - Quick reference for "where should I go?"

### Migration Path:

**Phase 1 (Now):**
- ✅ Articles is in navigation
- Keep all existing sections working
- Start publishing new content as articles

**Phase 2 (When Ready):**
- Move "Lost & Loved" content into Articles (category: "Lost & Loved")
- Keep Curiosities as unique interactive section
- Keep Dark History as premium scrollytelling
- Keep Scenes as photo gallery

**Phase 3 (Future):**
- Consider combining Bars/Restaurants/Coffee into unified "Guide" section
- Or convert them to article categories ("Best Of")

## Questions to Consider

1. **What's more important - browsing or reading?**
   - Browsing → Keep sections separate
   - Reading → Consolidate into Articles

2. **What's unique about each section?**
   - Curiosities: Scrolling + animations (unique)
   - Dark History: Premium scrollytelling (unique)
   - Scenes: Photo gallery (unique)
   - Events: Calendar view (unique)
   - Everything else: Could be articles

3. **How do people find content?**
   - Google search → They land on articles
   - Site navigation → They browse sections
   - Both matter!

4. **What scales?**
   - Articles scale infinitely (just add files)
   - Sections require maintenance (updating lists)

## Next Steps

**Option A: Keep Current Structure**
- Articles is now in nav
- Gradually migrate content to articles over time
- No breaking changes

**Option B: Consolidate Now**
- Decide which sections become article categories
- Move content over
- Redirect old URLs

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep unique interactive sections (Curiosities, Dark History, Scenes, Events)
- Move everything else to Articles with categories
- Best of both worlds

**My vote: Option C - It respects what's unique while making publishing easier**
