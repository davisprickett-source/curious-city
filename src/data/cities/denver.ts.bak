The land was Mount Prospect Cemetery from 1858 to 1890, filled primarily with paupers, criminals, and smallpox victims from the nearby "pest house." When the city decided to convert it to a park, families were given 90 days to claim their dead. Most bodies went unclaimed. The city hired undertaker E.P. McGovern to relocate the remaining 5,000+ corpses at $1.90 each. McGovern found a shortcut: he hacked the bodies apart and stuffed them into child-sized coffins, sometimes using three caskets for one adult. When the Denver Republican exposed "The Work Of Ghouls!" the city fired McGovern—but never hired anyone else. To this day, an estimated 2,000-3,000 bodies remain beneath the park. Construction crews still unearth bones regularly; four well-preserved skeletons were found as recently as 2010.

            body: 'The Croke-Patterson-Campbell Mansion was built in 1891 by Thomas Croke. He lived there for six months, then sold it for reasons he never explained—his mother had died there shortly after his wife. By the 1970s it was an office building that couldn\'t keep tenants: typewriters typed by themselves at night, party noises came from empty closets, babies cried from the third floor. During 1970s renovations, construction crews grew so frustrated with arriving to find their work undone that they brought in guard dogs. The next morning, both Dobermans were found dead on the sidewalk—they had apparently leapt from a third-floor window. The mansion is now a bed-and-breakfast called the Patterson Inn. Guests still report phantom dog barks from the upper floors.',
            verdict: 'The dogs are documented. The mansion is now a boutique hotel.',

            body: 'An 11-mile stretch between Thornton and Brighton has collected more paranormal legends than any road in Colorado. The "Gates of Hell" refer to iron gates marking where the Wolpert Mansion once stood—according to legend, a man burned it down with his family inside after becoming possessed. (The mansion was real; the fire happened in the 1970s when it was already abandoned.) Jogger\'s Hill near 120th Avenue is haunted by a phantom runner killed in a hit-and-run—locals say if you let him approach your driver\'s side window, you\'ll die. Drivers report a spectral Camaro that challenges them to race. An old dairy supposedly has a tree where accused witches were hanged. Warning signs have allegedly appeared reading "Hitchhikers May Be Demons." Ghost hunters report cold spots, strange feelings, and equipment malfunctions. The Denver Ghost Hunters\' Stephanie Smith: "I said \'I think there\'s something here, I don\'t feel alone.\'"',

            body: 'In November 1873, prospector Alferd Packer left Utah leading 21 men toward the Breckenridge gold fields. By February 1874, Packer stumbled out of the mountains alone—with a pocket full of cash, the other men\'s belongings, and a story that kept changing. First he said the men had died and he\'d eaten them to survive. Then he blamed Shannon Bell for killing everyone before Packer shot him in self-defense. Five hatchet-marked bodies were eventually found. Packer escaped jail and spent eight years on the run before being captured. He was sentenced to death (later reduced to 40 years) and became a morbid celebrity. The Denver Post championed his innocence in the 1890s, and after his 1901 parole, he worked as a guard at the Post. He died peacefully in Littleton in 1907. 1989 forensic examination suggested homicide. A 1990s study of his pistol suggested innocence. The truth died with Packer.',
