Thirty-five people died—the youngest a baby, the oldest ninety-two. Only one person survived the fall: Wesley MacIntire, whose truck bounced off the ship\'s bow before hitting the water. The pilot, John Lerro, was cleared of wrongdoing but never recovered, dying of multiple sclerosis complications in 2002.

When police found him the next morning, he wore a clean pressed shirt—though beneath it, his body was smeared with blood. He couldn\'t explain what had happened. The media dubbed him the "Dream Slayer" and blamed marijuana, transforming Licata into the poster child for Harry Anslinger\'s anti-cannabis crusade and the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act. The truth was simpler and sadder: Licata had been diagnosed with dementia praecox (schizophrenia) before the murders, and his family had a documented history of hereditary mental illness—his parents were first cousins, one brother was schizophrenic, and multiple relatives had been institutionalized. Cannabis was never mentioned in his psychiatric records. Licata escaped from the Florida Hospital for the Insane in 1945, was recaptured with help from a cousin in New Orleans, and hanged himself on December 4, 1950.',

The victims had nothing in common except that they were walking alone at night within a half-mile radius. Police flooded the neighborhood, warning residents not to go outside alone. On November 28, Howell Emanuel Donaldson III handed a McDonald\'s manager a bag containing a pistol and told her to bury it without looking inside. She called police.
