These fragments are what remains of the "White City" that introduced Ferris wheels, Cracker Jack, and electric lighting on a scale never seen before.

They never made it to a 12th. Three weeks later, their naked, frozen bodies were found dumped along German Church Road in Willow Springs. Despite one of the largest investigations in Chicago history—300 officers, thousands of interviews, even a personal plea from Elvis himself urging the killer to come forward—no one was ever charged. Multiple men falsely confessed. The case file remains open nearly 70 years later. The sisters went to see a movie about love and came home in body bags.',

The blaze spread rapidly through the 55-year-old wooden structure. 92 children and 3 nuns died—most from smoke inhalation, others from jumping from second-story windows onto concrete. Parents arriving to pick up their children found bodies lined up on the sidewalk, covered with coats. The cause was never definitively determined, though arson was suspected. The tragedy shocked a nation that assumed schools were safe and led to comprehensive fire safety reforms: mandatory sprinklers, fire drills, panic bars, fire-resistant construction. Every fire code in every American school today exists because 95 people burned to death in a Catholic elementary school on the Northwest Side.',
            verdict: 'Second-deadliest school fire in U.S. history. No one was ever charged. Schools nationwide installed sprinklers.',

Gacy was a respected community member, Democratic precinct captain, and married father who performed as "Pogo the Clown" at children\'s hospitals and charity events—which is the kind of detail that makes the horror somehow worse. He was finally caught in 1978 after 15-year-old Robert Piest disappeared following a job interview at Gacy\'s construction company. When police obtained a search warrant, the smell from the crawl space told them everything. The case revealed how a predator could hide in plain sight for six years while his house literally filled with corpses.',

All 271 aboard died, plus two on the ground. 273 total. It remains the deadliest aviation disaster in U.S. history. The cause: improper maintenance procedures and a flawed design that severed hydraulic lines when the engine detached. American Airlines had been using a forklift method to save 200 man-hours per engine change. The shortcut cost 273 lives. The FAA grounded all DC-10s for over a month. New regulations followed. A memorial now stands near the crash site, marking the spot where cutting corners caught up with American aviation.',

            body: 'In late September 1982, seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide. The victims—ranging from a 12-year-old girl to a 35-year-old postal worker—bought bottles from different stores across the suburbs, meaning someone was walking into pharmacies and placing poisoned pills on shelves like a twisted scavenger hunt. The murders sparked nationwide panic and an immediate recall of 31 million bottles. The case led to tamper-proof packaging, changed consumer product safety forever, and introduced America to the concept that someone might kill you for absolutely no reason other than the thrill of randomness. Despite one of the FBI\'s most intensive investigations and 40+ years of tips, no one has ever been charged. James Lewis, who sent an extortion letter, spent time in prison for that but was never connected to the murders. The killer is either dead or still out there, having gotten away with one of the most terrifying crimes in American history.',
            verdict: 'Unsolved. The case remains open. All victims died within 72 hours. The killer was never caught.',
