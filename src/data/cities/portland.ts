He planted flowers, named it Mill Ends Park, and began writing columns about Patrick O\'Toole, the leprechaun who supposedly lived there.\n\nFagan treated the park with absurd bureaucratic seriousness. He reported on miniature swimming pools being installed, tiny Ferris wheels appearing overnight, and elaborate leprechaun political scandals. When he died in 1969, the columns ended, but the park stayed. In 1976, Portland made it official—at 452 square inches, it entered Guinness World Records as Earth\'s smallest park.\n\nEngland tried to steal the title in 2018 with "Prince\'s Park" (217 square inches), but Portland fought back, arguing England\'s was a "publicity stunt" while Mill Ends had decades of documentation.

            body: 'When Voodoo Doughnut opened in 2003, the bacon maple bar was a genuinely strange idea. They sold a Pepto-Bismol doughnut and a NyQuil-frosted doughnut before the FDA shut that down. It was weird in the way Portland used to be weird—unselfconscious, a little gross, and doing it for the bit. Then it got famous. Now there are locations in multiple states, the lines are full of tourists with selfie sticks, and every local will tell you to go to Blue Star or Pip\'s Original instead. Voodoo isn\'t weird anymore. It\'s a brand. And that might be the most Portland story of all.',

Now there are hundreds—the little ones with the shock of colorful hair you remember from the \'90s—colonizing every surface of this forgotten overpass. Nobody knows who started it or why it continues, but pilgrims still make the 15-mile trip from downtown to add their own. Seattle has its famous 18-foot concrete Fremont Troll. Portland has this: weirder, grassroots, and nobody\'s in charge. That feels right.',

Its second-largest city was washed away in a flood—and officials told residents the dikes were safe 35 minutes before they collapsed. This was the only state admitted to the Union with a Black exclusion clause in its constitution. Serial killers hunted along its highways and dumped bodies in its beloved parks. The ghosts still wander the saloons and mansions. Portland\'s weirdness was always there—but so was the violence. It just wore better boots.',

What followed was the largest criminal investigation in Oregon history: 1,300 searchers combing the West Hills for ten days straight. No trace. Terri failed two polygraph tests. Investigators discovered she\'d tried to hire the family landscaper to kill her husband months earlier. A judge called her the "prime suspect." She has never been charged. Fifteen years later, over 4,000 tips from around the world have led nowhere. A $50,000 reward sits unclaimed. Kyron\'s glasses are still missing. So is Kyron.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, these passages were used for one of the city\'s most profitable side hustles: shanghaiing. Here\'s how it worked: You\'d stumble into Erickson\'s Saloon or the Snug Harbor for a drink. The bartender would slip you a mickey. You\'d wake up days later in the hold of a ship headed to Shanghai, legally bound to a two-year labor contract you never signed. Portland perfected this operation—at its peak, 1,500 men per year vanished through trapdoors. The city earned the title "Shanghai Capital of the World." Ship captains paid $50 a head (about $1,700 today) for warm bodies. The tunnels also doubled as opium dens, brothels, and murder disposal sites. The practice faded by the 1940s, but the tunnels remain—now rebranded as "ghost tours" through the darkness where human trafficking was good business.',

Vanport, Oregon\'s second-largest city—40,000 residents, 40% Black, built in 110 days during WWII to house Kaiser Shipyard workers—woke up to a flyer from the Housing Authority: "DIKES ARE SAFE AT PRESENT. YOU WILL BE WARNED IF NECESSARY. YOU WILL HAVE TIME TO LEAVE. DON\'T GET EXCITED." At 4:05 p.m., the railroad berm holding back the Columbia River collapsed. Water hit Vanport at 30 mph. Residents had 35 minutes. Fifteen people died officially—the real count was never confirmed. Eighteen thousand were left homeless. Nearly a third were Black, living in a state that had explicitly banned Black residency just 22 years earlier. Discriminatory housing laws barred survivors from most of Portland. Black residents were funneled into the overcrowded Albina district. By 1960, 80% of Black Portlanders lived in Albina—a concentration camp created by policy, not choice. The flood has been compared to Katrina for one reason: the government lied, the levees failed, and Black communities paid the price.',

            body: 'The White Eagle Saloon opened in 1905 to serve Polish immigrants, longshoremen, and men actively seeking violence. They called it "Bucket of Blood"—not metaphorically. Brawls were so common and brutal that blood literally pooled on the floor. The bar was also a shanghaiing hub: drink here, wake up on a ship to Shanghai. Drunken sailors were drugged and dragged through the basement to the waterfront, sold like cargo. Today, the White Eagle is a McMenamins property—and McMenamins\' most haunted one. Two ghosts have names and habits: Sam, a pre-Prohibition bartender who still lingers behind the bar, and Rose, whose backstory is contested but whose presence is not. Maybe she was a sex worker held captive in the basement. Maybe she was a worker murdered by a jealous lover. Either way, she weeps in the hotel hallway. Visitors report phantom fingertips on their necks, whispers in empty rooms, the feeling of being watched by something that doesn\'t blink. A waitress was shoved down the stairs by invisible hands. The beer\'s cold. The ghosts are colder.',
            verdict: 'USA Today named Portland one of America\'s ten most haunted cities. The White Eagle is where the dead drink.',

            body: 'Randall Woodfield was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 1974. Cut during training camp for "personality issues." By 1980, he was hunting women along the I-5 corridor from Washington to California, turning rejection into a five-month killing spree. He robbed, raped, stabbed, beat, and shot his victims—strangers and acquaintances both. He wore disguises. He was methodical. The first confirmed victim was Cherie Ayers, 29, found dead in her Portland home in January 1981. Bodies appeared throughout Oregon that winter. Woodfield was arrested in March 1981 after witnesses identified him. He was convicted of one murder. DNA has since linked him to at least 18 killings. Investigators suspect 44. He has never confessed. Ann Rule, who wrote "The I-5 Killer," suggested his rage stemmed from inadequacy—failing to make the NFL, failing to be somebody. So he became somebody by destroying women. He remains in Oregon State Penitentiary, still blaming everyone but himself.',

The mansion was absurdly ahead of its time: central vacuum system, intercom, walk-in refrigerator, elevator. Henry died in 1919. Georgiana in 1918—wait, she died first. Since then, visitors report phantom footsteps echoing through empty hallways, objects moving on their own, and the unmistakable scent of roses in rooms with no flowers. Some have seen the Pittocks walking hand-in-hand through the gardens—still together in death, still surveying their empire. Georgiana appears in upstairs windows, watching the city. Staff have photographed women reflected in mirrors when no one else was there. The mansion is now a museum. The Pittocks never got the memo. They still live there, wearing their best clothes, hosting guests who can\'t see them back.',

The 5,200-acre urban wilderness is Portland\'s pride: old-growth forest, 80+ miles of trails, the kind of place the city puts on postcards. Todd Alan Reed turned it into a graveyard for women no one was looking for. He targeted people on the margins—invisible victims in a city that branded itself as compassionate and livable. Reed knew Portland\'s secret: if you kill the right people, no one notices until it\'s too late. DNA linked him to all three murders. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2000. Oregon\'s death penalty has been under moratorium since 2011, so Reed sits in a cell, alive, while his victims decomposed in the city\'s favorite hiking spot.

He survived two weeks. She died in Hawthorne\'s asylum in 1879, her mind as broken as her marriage.

In 1859, Oregon became the only state admitted to the Union with a Black exclusion clause written into its constitution. Before statehood, the provisional government had passed the "Lash Law"—Black people who refused to leave would receive 39 lashes every six months until they complied. The exclusion clause wasn\'t removed from the constitution until 1926. Oregon didn\'t ratify the 15th Amendment (voting rights for Black men) until 1959—nearly a century late. The 14th Amendment (citizenship) wasn\'t ratified until 1973. By the 1920s, the KKK had 40,000 members in Oregon—15% of the white male population.
