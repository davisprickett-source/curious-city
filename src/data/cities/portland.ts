        intro: 'Portland\'s reputation as a progressive haven masks a history darker than its famous rain. This was the only state admitted to the Union with a Black exclusion clause in its constitution. The city earned its reputation as the "Shanghai Capital of the World" by kidnapping drunken men and selling them to ship captains. Its second-largest city was washed away in a flood—and the Black residents who lived there were left to fend for themselves. Serial killers have hunted along its highways. A child vanished from his elementary school and was never found. Portland\'s weirdness was always there, but so was the violence—it just dressed better.',

            body: 'In 1857, Oregon\'s constitutional convention voted on two proposals: legalizing slavery and banning Black people from the state entirely. Slavery failed. The exclusion law passed. Of 10,000 white men who voted, more than 8,500 chose to prohibit free Black people from living in Oregon. In 1859, Oregon became the only state admitted to the Union with such a clause in its constitution. Earlier, the provisional government had passed the "Lash Law"—Black people who refused to leave would receive 39 lashes, repeated every six months until they complied. The exclusion clause wasn\'t removed until 1926. Oregon didn\'t ratify the 15th Amendment (voting rights) until 1959—nearly a century after it was added to the U.S. Constitution. The 14th Amendment (citizenship) wasn\'t fully ratified until 1973. The legacy persists: Portland remains one of the whitest major cities in America.',
            verdict: 'The only state to enter the Union as an explicitly white-only territory. The KKK had 40,000 members in Oregon by the 1920s.',

            body: 'Beneath Portland\'s Old Town Chinatown lies a network of tunnels connecting basements, businesses, and the waterfront. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these passages were used for "shanghaiing"—kidnapping men from saloons, drugging them through trapdoors, and holding them underground until they could be sold to ship captains desperate for crew. At its peak, as many as 1,500 people per year were taken. Portland earned the title "Shanghai Capital of the World." The tunnels also served as holding cells, opium dens, and sites for prostitution. Murders were common—the underground was a convenient place to dispose of problems. Establishments like Erickson\'s Saloon and the Snug Harbor were notorious fronts. The practice declined by the 1940s, but the tunnels remain, now offered as ghost tours through the darkness where men were bought and sold.',

That morning, the Housing Authority issued a flyer: "DIKES ARE SAFE AT PRESENT. YOU WILL BE WARNED IF NECESSARY. YOU WILL HAVE TIME TO LEAVE. DON\'T GET EXCITED." At 4:05 p.m., a railroad berm holding back the Columbia River collapsed. Residents had 35 minutes to escape. Fifteen people died officially—the true count was likely higher. Eighteen thousand people were left homeless, nearly a third of them Black. Discriminatory housing laws meant most Black survivors could only relocate to the overcrowded Albina district. By 1960, nearly 80% of Black Portlanders lived in Albina. The flood has been compared to Katrina for the government\'s failure to protect a predominantly Black community.',

He stabbed, beat, and shot his victims. He used disguises. He attacked strangers and women he knew. The first confirmed victim was Cherie Ayers, 29, found dead in her Portland home. Bodies appeared throughout Oregon during that bitter winter. Woodfield was caught in 1981 and convicted of one murder, though DNA has since linked him to at least 18 killings. Investigators suspect as many as 44. He has never confessed. Ann Rule documented his crimes in "The I-5 Killer," suggesting that rejection and inadequacy—his failure to make the NFL—drove him to violence against women. He remains incarcerated at Oregon State Penitentiary.',

            body: 'In the spring and summer of 1999, three homeless women were raped and strangled in Portland. Their bodies were dumped in Forest Park, the 5,200-acre urban wilderness that Portlanders consider a crown jewel. Todd Alan Reed targeted women living on the margins—invisible victims in a city that prided itself on livability. Reed was arrested after DNA linked him to all three murders. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2000, though Oregon\'s death penalty has been under moratorium since 2011. The case exposed how vulnerable Portland\'s homeless population was—and how easy it was for a predator to hunt them without notice. Forest Park\'s trails, beloved by joggers and hikers, had become a dumping ground.',

His stepmother, Terri Horman, was the last person to see him alive. He vanished. The search that followed was the largest in Oregon history—1,300 searchers, ten days, no trace. Terri failed two polygraph tests. A judge later called her a "prime suspect." Investigators learned she had offered the family landscaper money to kill her husband months before Kyron disappeared. She has never been charged. Fifteen years later, Kyron\'s whereabouts remain unknown. Over 4,000 tips have come in from around the world. A $50,000 reward remains unclaimed. The case is Oregon\'s most haunting unsolved disappearance—a child who walked into his school and never walked out.',

In its early days, it was nicknamed "Bucket of Blood" for the violent brawls that spilled onto the floor. It was also a primary site for shanghaiing—drunken sailors were kidnapped from the bar and sold to ship captains through the basement. Today, the White Eagle is McMenamins\' most haunted property. Two ghosts have become so familiar they have names: Sam, a pre-Prohibition bartender, and Rose, a woman of uncertain history—perhaps a prostitute held captive in the basement, perhaps a worker murdered and discovered by her lover. Visitors report whispers, ghostly fingertips on their skin, and the feeling of being watched. A waitress was once pushed down the stairs by an unseen force. Rose\'s weeping shadow still wanders the hotel hallway.',

Since then, visitors have reported phantom footsteps, objects moving on their own, and the unmistakable scent of Georgiana\'s favorite rose wafting through empty rooms. Some have seen the Pittocks walking hand-in-hand through the gardens. Others have spotted Georgiana standing in an upstairs window, watching the city she helped build. Staff have photographed strange women reflected in mirrors when no one else was present. The mansion is now a public museum. The Pittocks, apparently, never left.',

But 10,000 of those graves are unmarked and unknown. Dr. James Hawthorne, who ran the Oregon Asylum for the Insane with unusual compassion, is buried alongside 185 of his patients. In 2007, an archaeological dig uncovered 50 more asylum patients who had been forgotten. Among the cemetery\'s notable residents is Charity Lamb, the first woman convicted of murder in Oregon Territory—she buried an axe in her husband\'s skull at the dinner table in 1854. He survived two weeks. She died in Hawthorne\'s asylum in 1879. Visitors report disheveled figures wandering the grounds and an unsettling presence among the unnamed graves.',
