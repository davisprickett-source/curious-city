  excerpt: 'Minnesota is the only place in America that plays "Duck Duck Grey Duck" instead of "Duck Duck Goose." The rest of the country thinks this is wrong. Minnesotans will fight you about it. Here\'s the surprisingly deep history behind the only regional children\'s game variant worth arguing about.',
