  subtitle: 'How the largest Somali community outside of Africa ended up in one of the coldest places in America — and built a capital city of the diaspora',
  excerpt: 'They came from a country where the temperature rarely drops below 70°F to a state where it regularly hits -20°F. They had no word for snow in their language. Now Minneapolis is home to the largest Somali population outside of Africa — over 100,000 people who transformed Cedar-Riverside into "Little Mogadishu," built an economy worth $8 billion, and sent a refugee to Congress. This is the story of how Minnesota became the unlikely capital of the Somali diaspora.',
