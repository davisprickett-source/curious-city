The complex hosted iconic acts like The Ramones, The Police, Iggy Pop, Sonic Youth, Pat Benatar, Steve Martin, and George Carlin. The entrance had a New York City subway-style design with paintings of trains. Author David Sedaris, who spent his high school years in Raleigh, remembered thinking "This is what New York is like!" The venue closed in 1984 due to safety and fire code concerns. While there have been occasional discussions about a revival, the space remains largely a piece of Raleigh\'s underground history.',

The venue is deliberately difficult to find — there\'s no signage, no Google Maps listing, and the entrance is through an unmarked alleyway accessible only to those in the know. Inside, you\'ll find period-accurate decor with dark wood paneling, vintage fixtures, and intimate alcoves lit by candlelight. The cocktail menu leans heavily into classics from the Jazz Age: properly made sidecars, Bee\'s Knees, and French 75s. Owner Barrett Mosko designed it as an homage to authentic speakeasy culture, where discretion was paramount and discovery felt like a secret handshake. The venue enforces a 25+ age requirement and maintains a strict dress code (no athletic wear, no baseball caps). Photography is actively discouraged to preserve the mystique. Live jazz on weekends. Reservations are hard to come by and often booked weeks in advance.',

The space transforms the restaurant\'s basement into an intimate cocktail lounge with warm amber lighting, plush velvet seating, exposed brick, and a moody jazz soundtrack. The cocktail menu focuses on French-inspired classics with creative twists — think lavender-infused Aviation cocktails and cognac-based concoctions. The bartenders work slowly and deliberately, treating each drink like a small production. Unlike some speakeasies that feel gimmicky, Sous Terre earns its name through genuine atmosphere. No reservations required, but seating is limited to about 40 people, so arrive early on weekends. The vibe is date night, late-night conversations, and escaping the chaos of Glenwood above.',

            description: 'The first and only cylindrical classroom building ever constructed on an American university campus. Built in 1961 on NC State\'s campus, Harrelson Hall was a bold architectural experiment — a 206-foot-diameter concrete drum with continuous circular hallways that looped around the building\'s core. Students called it "the round building," and walking its curved corridors created a disorienting, almost nautical sensation. The building had no right angles, which sounds cool in theory but proved nightmarish in practice. Furniture didn\'t fit. Sound bounced weirdly. Students got lost. The circular design meant every classroom had a curved back wall, making teaching awkward. Despite its problems, Harrelson became iconic — a symbol of mid-century optimism about futuristic architecture. But by the 2000s, it was obsolete, cramped, and expensive to maintain. NC State demolished it in 2016. Students mourned its loss, not because it was functional, but because it was weird, beloved, and irreplaceable. Photos and memories are all that remain of America\'s brief, strange experiment with round classrooms.',

Before radar and GPS, pilots navigated cross-country using visual landmarks. In the 1920s and 30s, the federal government painted giant directional arrows on rooftops across America, pointing pilots toward the nearest airport. This arrow pointed to Raleigh Municipal Airport (now closed). Most of these navigation arrows have been painted over or demolished, making Raleigh\'s one of the few survivors. The arrow is only visible from above — drones, tall buildings, or from The Architect Bar\'s rooftop deck. WRAL captured aerial footage showing the arrow still clearly visible despite decades of weathering. It\'s a hidden piece of aviation history, literally hiding in plain sight above downtown.',
