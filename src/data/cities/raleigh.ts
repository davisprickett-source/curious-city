            body: 'Velma Barfield looked like someone\'s grandmother. She was. She was also a serial killer who poisoned at least four people—including her own mother—with arsenic-laced drinks, killing them slowly over days while "nursing" them. Her final victim, boyfriend Stuart Taylor, died in February 1978 after she feared he\'d discovered her check forgery. She blamed her addiction to tranquilizers and painkillers. On death row, Barfield became a devout Christian, ministering to other prisoners and earning the support of Billy Graham, who pleaded for clemency. Governor Jim Hunt, facing re-election, refused. On November 2, 1984, Velma Barfield became the first woman executed in America in 22 years. Her last meal was Cheez Doodles and Coca-Cola. Her final statement apologized to "everybody who has gone through a lot of pain."',

Doors were double-locked. The media called it the most terrifying year in Raleigh history. In 1997, John Williams Jr., a homeless man, was arrested and eventually sentenced to death for two of the murders—Patricia Ashe and Deborah Elliot. But the case fractured: Leman Evans was convicted separately for killing Dewanna Burt. Three victims—Dawn Grandy, Cynthia Brown, and Patricia Woods—remain unsolved. Williams, now in his late 50s, still sits on death row at Central Prison. The year of fear ended, but the questions didn\'t.',

Mary Willis Mordecai Turk is the most famous spirit—seen playing the piano in period dress, appearing as a floating orb near the instrument she loved. Paranormal investigators have documented cold spots, unexplained sounds, and a pervasive sense of grief on the staircase where, legend says, a baby died after being scalded in a bath. The Ghost Guild has been the park\'s official paranormal research team since 2017, presenting findings every October.

A night watchman who worked there for 15 years reported screaming, slamming doors, books crashing in the third-floor library, breaking glass, jingling keys, and footsteps on stone floors—all while the building was empty. The manually-operated elevator ran up and down on its own. In 1981, a curator working late encountered an apparition in the doorway of the committee room off the senate chamber. The figure dissolved. The smell of cigar smoke appears without explanation. A shadow figure moves near the Governor\'s Office—believed by some to be Zebulon Vance, the Civil War governor who fled as Sherman approached. The Capitol\'s underground escape tunnels, built during the Civil War, add to the building\'s unease.',

She died unexpectedly in 1918 at 38 years old. According to local lore, at midnight every Halloween, the angel\'s head spins twelve times. Some claim the carved stone eyes follow you as you move. Visitors report being pushed, scratched, and shoved. In the Confederate section, sounds of gunshots and shouting echo across the graves. The cemetery added the grounds to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The dead, apparently, take no notice of such honors.',

The building housed the city\'s first YMCA, its first Catholic Church, and the Raleigh Little Theatre. Now it\'s the City of Raleigh Museum.
