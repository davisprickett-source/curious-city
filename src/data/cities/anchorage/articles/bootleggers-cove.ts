  title: 'The Wettest Dry Town in Alaska',
  subtitle: 'Alaska went dry two years before the rest of America. Anchorage responded by becoming a paradise for bootleggers. With only 1,900 residents, the town supported 40 speakeasies. Smugglers landed contraband at a hidden inlet. The city paid children bounties to rat out moonshiners. This is the story of Bootlegger\'s Cove.',
  excerpt: 'In 1917, Alaska banned alcohol sales — two years before national Prohibition. Anchorage, a rough railroad town of 1,900 people, responded predictably: it became one of the wettest dry towns in America. Bootleggers landed contraband at a hidden cove on Cook Inlet. Forty speakeasies operated openly. The legendary "Phantom Swede" ran liquor with impunity. Children earned $5 bounties for reporting illegal stills. Anchorage was born drunk, and Prohibition only made it thirstier.',
