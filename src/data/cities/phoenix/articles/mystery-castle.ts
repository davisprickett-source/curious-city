  title: 'Mystery Castle: A Father\'s Secret Desert Castle',
  subtitle: 'In 1927, Boyce Gulley vanished from his family without explanation. For 16 years, he secretly built an 18-room castle out of junk for the daughter he\'d left behind. She only found out after he died.',
  excerpt: 'When Boyce Gulley was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1927, he disappeared from his wife and three-year-old daughter without a word. He spent the next 16 years in the Arizona desert, secretly building an 18-room castle from car parts, goat milk, and salvaged junk — all for the daughter who thought he\'d abandoned her. She inherited it after his death, along with hidden treasure, love letters, and a childhood Valentine she\'d made for him decades earlier.',
