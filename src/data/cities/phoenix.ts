They were given American names, forced into uniforms, their hair cut short. Physical punishment was common for infractions as small as speaking a native word. Children were used as labor for local farms and businesses. Disease swept through the crowded dormitories—in January 1900 alone, measles killed nine children in ten days. Students who ran away sometimes died trying to reach home. When the school finally closed in 1990, departing students carved their names into the walls to prove they had existed.

At Union Station, a baggage handler noticed the trunks were leaking and smelled foul. Police met the train. Judd fled, then surrendered at a funeral home five days later. The press dubbed her the "Trunk Murderess," the "Tiger Woman," and the "Blonde Butcher." She claimed self-defense—all three women had been shot, including her. She was sentenced to hang, but days before execution was declared insane and transferred to the Arizona State Mental Hospital. Over 38 years, she escaped seven times. The last escape lasted six years—she lived as a nanny in California under an assumed name. She was finally pardoned in 1971 and died in 1998 at 93.

He died eleven days later after surgeons amputated three of his limbs trying to save him.
