Every Thursday night, they host swing dancing in the main cavern — live bands, lessons for beginners, and an atmosphere you genuinely cannot replicate anywhere else.

In the absence of external sound, you start hearing things you never knew existed: your heartbeat, blood flowing through your veins, the whoosh of your eyeballs moving in their sockets. Most people become disoriented within 30 minutes. Some hallucinate. NASA uses similar chambers to test astronauts. It\'s a genuinely surreal experience that challenges your sense of reality.',

Founded by a collective of artists and coffee obsessives, it started in a 1926 Whittier brownstone and grew into the city\'s most influential roaster. Each location has its own personality — the original Whittier\'s quirky nooks and mid-century furniture, Northeast\'s soaring industrial ceilings, Uptown\'s prime people-watching, Downtown\'s refined hotel-lobby elegance — but they\'re all united by the same ethos: coffee as craft, not commodity. Their roasting operation supplies restaurants across the Midwest, but they still act like a neighborhood shop.',

No cane sugar. No beef, pork, or chicken. Instead: bison, elk, duck, wild rice, maple, sumac, cedar, foraged plants from the forests that once covered this land. Chef Sean Sherman spent years researching pre-colonial foodways, partnering with tribal nations, and building supply chains with Indigenous producers across North America. The 2022 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant was just recognition of what diners already knew: this is revolutionary. The restaurant overlooks Owámniyomni — St. Anthony Falls — the sacred Dakota site that gave Minneapolis its original name. Every detail matters. Every dish tells a story of survival, resistance, and reclamation. Come with respect, leave transformed.',

The whole experience — the tiny candelit space, the tango playing, the Argentine rock on the speakers — feels like a secret your cool friend told you about.

The family called police at 8 p.m., but detectives didn\'t arrive at the Klein home until 6:30 p.m. the following day—nearly 24 hours after the boys vanished. Two of the boys\' caps were found in the nearby icy Mississippi River, leading authorities to drag the river fearing they\'d drowned. Nothing was recovered. The case was closed after just five days. Decades later, investigators learned a neighbor had poured fresh concrete in his basement and replaced his wooden truck bed the day after the boys disappeared. That neighbor became a suspect, but he died before he could be questioned. In 2021, advanced forensic techniques examined that concrete basement—finding nothing.

Gerdes had been stabbed repeatedly around her neck, chest, and back, with a long open wound leading to her sternum—apparently from a missing French chef\'s stainless steel knife taken from the kitchen\'s butcher block. Her body had been posed. The primary suspect, Patrick Thomas Walsh, didn\'t emerge until 1991, after he murdered 35-year-old Pamela Sweeney in Roseville—a coworker who had rebuffed his romantic advances. Walsh had a 1976 conviction for choking a woman in her apartment and was linked to the 1980 disappearance of 22-year-old Cindy M. Brown. But investigators could never connect the forensic dots to charge him with Gerdes\' murder. Walsh is serving life in prison at Minnesota Correctional Facility in Stillwater for Sweeney\'s murder, but Gerdes\' case remains unsolved. Former Minneapolis Police Chief Tony Bouza, who died in 2023, was haunted by the case for decades. "Left unaddressed, the searing murder of Cindy Gerdes stands as a damning indictment of our indifference to our neighbor\'s plight," Bouza wrote on his website.',

            title: 'Jeanie Childs: How a Discarded Napkin Solved a 26-Year-Old Murder',
            body: 'On June 13, 1993, 35-year-old Jeanie Childs was found brutally murdered in her south Minneapolis apartment, stabbed 65 times. Blood covered the walls of her bedroom, living room, and bathroom. The bathroom was flooding—the killer had left the shower running. Bloody bare footprints led away from the scene, different from Childs\' socked feet. Despite collecting DNA evidence, the case went cold for 25 years. In 2015, a Minneapolis homicide detective and FBI special agent reopened the investigation using advances in DNA testing. Forensic scientist Andrea Feia noticed one unknown DNA profile repeated throughout the crime scene. That profile was submitted to genealogy websites, including MyHeritage.com, where it matched a first cousin to the killer. Investigators constructed a family tree pointing to Jerry Westrom, a 52-year-old married father of two from Isanti, about 40 miles north of Minneapolis. He\'d never been a suspect. Police followed Westrom to a hockey game in Wisconsin and retrieved a napkin he\'d thrown away after eating a hot dog. The DNA matched. Westrom was arrested in February 2019. His footprint matched the bloody prints at the scene. In 2023, a Hennepin County jury deliberated two hours before finding Westrom guilty of first- and second-degree murder. The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. It was Minnesota\'s first murder solved using forensic investigative genetic genealogy.',
            verdict: 'Solved. Jerry Westrom convicted of first-degree murder in 2023 via genetic genealogy.',
