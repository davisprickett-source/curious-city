  title: 'Victim of the Beast 666',
  subtitle: 'A cryptic gravestone in Salt Lake City Cemetery has puzzled visitors for decades. The inscription reads "Victim of the Beast 666." The truth behind it is stranger than the legend — and far more mundane.',
  excerpt: 'In Salt Lake City Cemetery, a modest red granite headstone has drawn curiosity-seekers for decades. It marks the grave of Lilly E. Gray, who died in 1958 at age 77. Below her name and dates is a single, enigmatic line: "Victim of the Beast 666." Ghost hunters love it. Conspiracy theorists have spun elaborate tales. The real story involves a paranoid husband, a grudge against the government, and a reminder that the most compelling mysteries sometimes have the most ordinary explanations.',

The name is ordinary: Lilly E. Gray. The dates are unremarkable: 1881-1958. But beneath that information, carved into the stone in letters that have never been explained by any official record, is a phrase that has launched a thousand theories: "Victim of the Beast 666."',

True crime podcasts have devoted episodes to the mystery. The inscription seems to promise something terrible, something hidden, something that someone wanted carved in stone forever.',
