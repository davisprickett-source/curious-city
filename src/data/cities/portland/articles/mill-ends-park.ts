  title: 'Mill Ends Park: The World\'s Smallest Park',
  subtitle: 'A journalist planted flowers in a pothole to annoy his leprechaun. Now it\'s an official city park, 452 square inches, with its own swimming pool for butterflies.',
  excerpt: 'In 1948, Portland newspaper columnist Dick Fagan looked out his office window and saw a leprechaun digging in an abandoned hole in a traffic median. He caught the leprechaun, wished for a park, and got exactly what he asked for: a circle two feet across, officially the world\'s smallest park. For decades it had a tiny swimming pool, hosted snail races, and was home to "the only leprechaun colony west of Ireland." Portland has never stopped being weird.',
