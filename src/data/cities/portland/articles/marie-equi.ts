  title: 'Dr. Marie Equi: Portland\'s Lesbian Anarchist Doctor',
  subtitle: 'She horsewhipped a school superintendent, performed illegal abortions for the poor, stabbed a cop with a hatpin, and went to prison for opposing World War I. Portland has mostly forgotten her.',
  excerpt: 'In the early 1900s, Dr. Marie Equi was one of Portland\'s most prominent physicians — and one of its most dangerous radicals. She provided abortions and birth control when both were illegal, lived openly with her female partner, adopted a child in one of America\'s first same-sex families, and was imprisoned for sedition. She was called "the most dangerous woman in Oregon." This is her story.',
