  subtitle: 'Trollwood Park is where Fargo goes for summer concerts and theater. It\'s also where the county buried its poor, its sick, and its forgotten for half a century. Over 350 graves have been found. More keep appearing. The dead won\'t stay buried.',
  excerpt: 'Trollwood Park hosts Fargo\'s beloved summer arts festival. It used to be the Cass County Poor Farm — a facility for the destitute, the elderly, and the mentally ill. When residents died without money or family, the county buried them on-site in unmarked graves. Over 350 bodies have been found. River erosion keeps revealing more. The park where families picnic is also a mass grave for the people Fargo forgot.',
