  title: 'The Ten-Minute Divorce',
  subtitle: 'In the 1880s and 1890s, Fargo was the divorce capital of America. The territory\'s lenient laws allowed unhappy spouses to end marriages in minutes. One judge granted 350 divorces in a single year. People traveled from Europe to escape their marriages in North Dakota.',
  excerpt: 'Before Vegas weddings, there were Fargo divorces. In the late 1800s, Dakota Territory had the most lenient divorce laws in America — so lenient that you could arrive by train, file papers, and be legally single before lunch. Fargo became internationally famous as the place where marriages went to die. One local judge granted 350 divorces in a single year. The "divorce mill" ran for decades until scandalized citizens finally shut it down.',

She checked into the Headquarters Hotel, left her bag in her room, walked to the courthouse, filed for divorce, appeared before a judge, and was granted a decree dissolving her marriage. The entire process took less than a day. By evening, she was back on a train heading east, legally single, her unhappy marriage officially over.',
