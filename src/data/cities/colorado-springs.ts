            body: 'In 1899, Tesla built a massive experimental station in Colorado Springs, drawn by the city\'s high altitude and dry air — perfect for electrical experiments. His laboratory, topped with an 80-foot mast and a copper ball, generated artificial lightning bolts reportedly reaching 135 feet. The experiments were so powerful they knocked out the Colorado Springs Electric Company generator, plunging the city into darkness. Tesla claimed he received extraterrestrial radio signals — possibly from Mars — though they were likely natural atmospheric phenomena. His Colorado Springs notes, published posthumously, remain among the most enigmatic documents in electrical engineering history. The site at Foote Avenue and Kiowa Street is now a parking lot, marked only by a small plaque.',

            body: 'On December 24, 1955, a Sears department store in Colorado Springs ran a newspaper ad inviting children to call Santa directly. But the phone number was misprinted — it connected to the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), NORAD\'s predecessor, at what\'s now Peterson Space Force Base. Colonel Harry Shoup, the officer on duty that night, was initially confused but quickly played along, checking his "radar" and giving children Santa\'s location. His staff continued answering calls all night. The tradition stuck. Today, NORAD Tracks Santa is a massive operation: over 1,500 volunteers answer calls, emails, and social media messages from more than 150 countries. The website receives millions of visitors every Christmas Eve. What started as a phone typo became one of the military\'s most beloved public relations traditions.',

The ascent took hours through thin air and treacherous switchbacks. When she reached the top and saw the view — "purple mountain majesties" stretching west, "amber waves of grain" spreading east across the Great Plains — she was overwhelmed. She scribbled notes that evening in her Colorado Springs hotel room, which became the poem "America the Beautiful." Published in 1895 and set to music in 1910, it has been performed at presidential inaugurations, proposed as a replacement for the national anthem, and sung at countless patriotic events. Bates never imagined her mule ride would produce one of America\'s most beloved songs. She later revised it twice, but the imagery she saw from Pikes Peak remained.',

The new Swiss-made trains feature panoramic windows, onboard restrooms, and heating systems that work at 14,000 feet. Every tie, rail, and switch was replaced. The summit visitor center was redesigned with floor-to-ceiling windows framing the view that inspired "America the Beautiful." When it reopened in May 2021, it was essentially a brand-new railway on a historic route, climbing 7,500 vertical feet over 8.9 miles of track with grades up to 24%.

The modernist design — 17 aluminum-clad steel spires soaring 150 feet skyward — outraged traditionalists. Critics called it "a pile of broken glass," "fighter jets nose-diving into the ground," and worse. Members of Congress tried to block funding. Religious groups objected to its unconventional design. Netsch defended it as expressing "aspiration to the heavens" in a form befitting the Space Age. Construction proceeded despite protests, finishing in 1962 at a cost of $3.5 million. Inside, light streams through stained glass panels in the Protestant chapel, while Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist, and Muslim chapels occupy the lower levels. Today, it\'s a National Historic Landmark, one of the most photographed buildings in Colorado, and widely considered a masterpiece of modernist religious architecture.

Some are sweet, others bitter, some fizzy with natural carbonation from deep underground CO2. The Ute people considered these springs sacred healing waters and traveled here for centuries. When William Jackson Palmer founded Colorado Springs in 1871, he marketed neighboring Manitou Springs as a health resort, building grand hotels to house tuberculosis patients seeking the "curative waters." Visitors would "take the waters" by drinking from each spring, believing the minerals healed various ailments. You can still taste all eight for free by following the self-guided Mineral Springs Walking Tour.',

When Perkins died in 1909, his will gifted the land to Colorado Springs with one iron-clad condition: "It shall be open, forever, free to the public." The city accepted. Over the years, additional donations expanded it to 1,367 acres. True to Perkins\' wishes, Garden of the Gods has never charged admission — not for parking, not for trails, not for rock climbing. The red sandstone fins and towers are 300 million years old, originally deposited as sand dunes and beaches. When the Rocky Mountains thrust upward 65 million years ago, these ancient rocks tilted nearly vertical. Balanced Rock, Kissing Camels, Cathedral Spires — all free, forever. Over 6 million visitors a year walk through a park that exists because one man insisted beauty belongs to everyone.',

This 14,000-square-foot mansion, built in 1895 by French priest Father Jean Baptiste Francolon, defies every principle of coherent design — and that\'s precisely what makes it fascinating. Nine different architectural styles clash and harmonize across four stories: Romanesque, Gothic, Tudor, Elizabethan Mock, Venetian Ogee, Byzantine, and more. The story gets stranger when you learn Father Francolon may have been fleeing scandal in France, arriving in Manitou Springs with his mother and building this bizarre monument to eclecticism. The castle later served as a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients before becoming a private residence, then a museum. Today, you can wander rooms that shift from medieval stone arches to Victorian parlors to Moorish windows. The Queen\'s Tea Room on the main floor serves proper Victorian tea service among the architectural chaos. It\'s gloriously weird, utterly Colorado Springs, and unlike anything else you\'ll see.',

Most visitors stop at Helen Hunt Falls, a 35-foot cascade named for the activist writer who championed Native American rights. But drive all the way to the top and you\'ll find the trailheads that matter: Mount Cutler for panoramic views of the city, Columbine Trail through aspen groves, and the punishing Seven Bridges Trail that climbs to high alpine terrain. The canyon is free, rarely crowded, and stunningly beautiful — especially in fall when aspens turn gold against red rock. It\'s Garden of the Gods\' quieter, wilder sibling, and locals prefer it that way.',

The wooden floors creak under vintage machines: antique fortune tellers in glass cases, hand-cranked mutoscopes showing grainy Old West scenes, skee ball lanes worn smooth by generations of players. Some games genuinely cost a penny. Others are a nickel or dime. The modern world hasn\'t entirely intruded — there are contemporary arcade games too — but the soul of the place is pure Depression-era Americana. Kids love it. Adults find it nostalgic. The vibe is wonderfully unpretentious, with none of the high-tech flash of modern arcades. Just wooden cabinets, mechanical games, and the satisfying clink of coins. Get a bag of pennies at the counter, try your luck at the fortune-telling Zoltar machine, and waste an hour in the best possible way.',

You wander a dirt main street past a blacksmith shop, general store, saloon with a player piano, and a sheriff\'s office with an honest-to-God jail cell. Antique arcade machines still work if you feed them quarters. A mechanical fortune teller dispenses wisdom from a glass case. Kids can pan for gold in a wooden sluice — and yes, adults get just as into it. The museum feels frozen in time, a 1950s roadside attraction that somehow survived. There\'s no slick interpretation or interactive displays. Just weathered wood, dusty artifacts, and the faint smell of old buildings. It\'s hokey, charming, and genuinely fun. Perfect for a rainy day or when you\'ve had enough of nature and want something wonderfully, unapologetically touristy.',

            description: 'Colorado\'s newest state park (opened 2006) sits in the shadow of Cheyenne Mountain, offering 21 miles of trails through high-desert grasslands and scrub oak forests with shockingly few crowds. While tourists mob Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak, locals come here to hike, mountain bike, and watch wildlife. Elk graze in open meadows at dawn. Mule deer browse along trails. Wild turkeys strut through campsites. The Front Range rises dramatically to the west, Pikes Peak to the north. The park preserves 1,680 acres of Colorado\'s disappearing transition zone — that sweet spot between plains and mountains where ponderosa pines meet prairie grasses. The trails range from easy nature walks to lung-busting climbs. The Blackmer Loop offers panoramic views of the entire region. The Zook Loop winds through quiet canyon country. Camping is excellent, with electric hookups and modern facilities. Unlike Colorado\'s older, more famous parks, Cheyenne Mountain State Park feels uncrowded, pristine, and underappreciated — exactly the way locals like it.',

All were found in their beds, heads caved in. Despite a massive investigation, no one was ever charged. Retired investigator Dwight Haverkorn wrote a book, "Murder in the Shadow of Pikes Peak" (2024), arguing this was part of a railroad-riding serial killer\'s spree that claimed 25 victims across five states in 1911.',

The historic chapel is the epicenter of paranormal activity — visitors report strange noises, unexplained sounds, and dark figures near the casket-lifting device and staircase. During nighttime tours, guests have photographed a flying figure hovering over tombstones — described as a five-foot cat-like entity that doesn\'t touch the ground. The cemetery was featured on the Biography Channel\'s "My Ghost Story." Even cemetery employees admit the place feels eerie, especially after dark.',
            verdict: 'The cemetery is open to the public. The ghosts don\'t follow a schedule.',
