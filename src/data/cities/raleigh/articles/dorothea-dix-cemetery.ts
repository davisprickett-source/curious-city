  title: 'The Numbered Graves: Dorothea Dix Cemetery',
  subtitle: 'For over a century, patients who died at Raleigh\'s mental hospital were buried with only a number. No names. No families. Just a cross and a stamped metal tag. Now volunteers are trying to give them back their identities.',
  excerpt: 'Between 1859 and 1970, over 900 patients died at Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh. Most were buried in the hospital cemetery with no name — just a numbered metal tag, a cross, and silence. The stigma of mental illness meant families abandoned them even in death. For over a century, they were anonymous. Now volunteers are uncovering their names and restoring their markers, one grave at a time.',
