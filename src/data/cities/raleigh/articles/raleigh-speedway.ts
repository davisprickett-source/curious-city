  title: 'The Lost Speedway: NASCAR\'s Forgotten Raleigh Track',
  subtitle: 'A mile-long NASCAR superspeedway lies buried in the woods near Atlantic Avenue. It was supposed to be Daytona. Now it\'s pine trees and asphalt fragments, a ghost track where racing legends once roared.',
  excerpt: 'In the 1950s, Raleigh had a NASCAR superspeedway — a one-mile oval where legends like Lee Petty and Fireball Roberts competed under the first nighttime lights in racing history. Bill France Sr. built it to rival Daytona. Then the city complained about noise, banned Sunday racing, and killed it. The track closed in 1958. Today, only a fragment of the backstretch survives, hidden in the woods near an industrial park.',
