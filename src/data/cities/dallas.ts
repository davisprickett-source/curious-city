The official historical marker claims it honors Vice President George Mifflin Dallas, but Bryan established the town before Dallas took office, and there\'s no evidence they ever met. Other theories: Bryan was honoring George\'s brother, Commodore Alexander James Dallas. Or two Dallas brothers who were his friends. Or a Dallas County in Alabama. Or it\'s corrupted from a Native American word. Bryan spent his final years in an insane asylum in Austin and took the answer to his grave. The mystery has persisted for 180 years.

In 1985, U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders (yes, real name) ruled the law unconstitutional as applied to private conduct. But here\'s the thing: the city never bothered to repeal it. The ordinance remains in the municipal code, technically enforceable, a relic of Reagan-era vice policing. Every few years a local news station rediscovers it. The city council shrugs. Nobody fixes it. Welcome to Texas.',

He looked toward the ruins and saw a small boy standing in a clearing. Then two more children appeared beside him. When the salesman walked closer, all three vanished.

The earliest published account appeared in 1943, but the legend is most often credited to Guy Malloy, Neiman Marcus\'s display director for 40 years, who loved telling the story. Some versions say she drowned in a boating accident; others claim suicide. Two real drownings have been suggested as the ghost\'s origin: Louise Ford Davis in 1935 and Rose Stone in 1942. But Sally Rodriguez, the lake\'s unofficial historian, has researched every death record. "I\'ve found lots of stories," she says, "but no stories that match."

Their car launched off the road and crashed into the opposite bank of the ravine, landing upside down. Mary Lou Goldner, 16, and Claudie Jean Reeves, 17, died instantly. Kathy Fleming died later. Three others survived with severe injuries. Ironically, Claudie\'s father was a highway patrolman; investigating officers paused their work to attend her funeral. A grand jury investigated four Arlington High boys for arson—they\'d set the bridge on fire as a "prank"—but called it "childish" and declined to press charges. The wooden bridge was soon replaced with a concrete culvert.

She and her little brother found a "cool" ramp in an abandoned Winn-Dixie parking lot two-tenths of a mile from home. Her brother went back; Amber stayed. At 3:15 p.m., a man in a black pickup truck grabbed her from behind. A 78-year-old retired sheriff\'s deputy witnessed it from his backyard and called 911, but could only describe the truck—a black 1980s or \'90s full-sized pickup with no chrome. Four days later, a dog walker found Amber\'s body in a creek bed near some apartments. Her throat had been cut. The medical examiner determined she\'d been kept alive for at least two days. Police have sifted through more than 8,000 leads over nearly three decades. No arrest has ever been made. But ten months after her death, Dallas-Fort Worth broadcasters launched a new emergency system in her name. The AMBER Alert has since helped recover over 1,200 children nationwide.',
            verdict: 'Unsolved. The killer has never been identified despite decades of investigation and thousands of tips. The case remains active with Arlington Police.',

But Billy Chemirmir wasn\'t a caregiver making house calls. He was a predator. The Kenyan immigrant would pose as a maintenance worker or medical professional, talk his way into apartments, then smother his victims with pillows and steal their jewelry. The smothering left almost no evidence. At least 18 women died before 91-year-old Mary Annis Bartel survived an attack in March 2018. "Go to bed. Don\'t fight me," he told her. She lost consciousness but lived. Her description led police to Chemirmir the next day—just as he was tossing a jewelry box into a dumpster. Inside: items belonging to his latest victim, 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris, found dead that same evening. Chemirmir was indicted for 22 murders, convicted of two, and sentenced to life without parole. In September 2023, his cellmate killed him in prison.',

            body: 'The story goes like this: In the late 1930s, a Black goat farmer named Oscar Washburn lived near the Old Alton Bridge in Denton County. He was good at his trade—so good he hung a sign on the bridge: "This Way to the Goatman." His success enraged local Klansmen. One night in August 1938, they crossed the bridge, dragged Washburn from his home, and hanged him from the iron trusses. But when they looked over the edge to make sure he was dead, the noose was empty. Panicked, they returned to his home and murdered his wife and children. Now, on dark nights, people report glowing eyes in the woods, the sound of hooves on the bridge, and a growling voice ordering them to leave. Paranormal investigators flock here. The reality is more complicated: researchers have found no census records of Oscar Washburn, no newspaper accounts of a 1938 lynching, no death certificates. But racist violence absolutely happened in Denton County during that era—the newspapers just didn\'t print the victims\' names. The Goatman may be a ghost story, but the terror it describes was real.',
