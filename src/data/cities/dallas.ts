The official historical marker claims it honors Vice President George Mifflin Dallas, but Bryan established the town before Dallas took office, and there\'s no evidence they ever met. Other theories: Bryan was honoring George\'s brother, Commodore Alexander James Dallas. Or two Dallas brothers who were his friends. Or a Dallas County in Alabama. Or it\'s corrupted from a Native American word. Bryan spent his final years in an insane asylum in Austin and took the answer to his grave. The mystery has persisted for 180 years.

In 1985, U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders (yes, real name) ruled the law unconstitutional as applied to private conduct. But here\'s the thing: the city never bothered to repeal it. The ordinance remains in the municipal code, technically enforceable, a relic of Reagan-era vice policing. Every few years a local news station rediscovers it. The city council shrugs. Nobody fixes it. Welcome to Texas.',
