Then in 1969, engineering students actually measured it and discovered the marker was three steps too low. The legislature ceremoniously installed a new brass marker on the 18th step. Problem solved. Except in 2003, the National Geodetic Survey showed up with GPS and found the 18th step was also wrong—three feet too high. A third marker went on the 15th step. The original 1909 marker remains because tourists expect it. So now there are three "official" mile-high markers on the same staircase, none of which agree. The state just lives with it.',

The piece was commissioned in 1992 for $300,000 but wasn\'t installed until 2008, two years after Jiménez\'s death—his sons completed it from his detailed plans. Jiménez designed the blue as tribute to lowrider culture, the eyes as homage to his father\'s neon sign shop. But the death, those eyes, that stance—it feeds DIA\'s conspiracy mythology perfectly.

            body: 'Cheesman Park is one of Denver\'s most beloved green spaces—80 acres of manicured lawns where joggers run and couples picnic. It\'s also a mass grave. The land was Mount Prospect Cemetery from 1858 to 1890, filled with paupers, criminals, and smallpox victims. When the city decided to convert it to a park, families got 90 days to claim their dead. Most went unclaimed. The city hired undertaker E.P. McGovern to relocate 5,000+ corpses at $1.90 each. McGovern found a shortcut: hack bodies apart, stuff them into child-sized coffins, sometimes using three caskets for one adult. When the Denver Republican exposed "The Work Of Ghouls!" the city fired McGovern—but never hired anyone else. To this day, an estimated 2,000-3,000 bodies remain beneath the park. Construction crews still unearth bones regularly. Four well-preserved skeletons surfaced as recently as 2010. You\'ve probably picnicked on a corpse.',

A mob of 3,000 descended on Hop Alley—the Chinese neighborhood near present-day Coors Field—beating residents and destroying every business. Look Young, a 28-year-old who had lived in Denver for just six months, was dragged from Sing Lee\'s laundry, had his queue cut off, was beaten and tortured, then hanged from a lamppost. He died of his injuries. The rioters caused $53,655 in damage (over $1.5 million today). No one was ever convicted. The Chinese consul\'s request for reparations was denied. Chinatown never recovered. In 2022—142 years later—Denver formally apologized. The site is now a parking lot near the ballpark.',

The killer was meticulous: he collected all 18 shell casings, wiped away fingerprints, and took the surveillance tapes. Seventeen of his eighteen shots hit their targets, suggesting professional training. Three weeks later, police arrested retired Denver police sergeant James King, who had worked as a guard at the bank and had substantial debt. The nationally televised trial ended in acquittal after nine days of jury deliberation. King died of dementia in 2023 at 77. The money was never found. No one else was ever charged.

The trigger: socialite Isabel Springer, who lived at the hotel with her millionaire husband while carrying on affairs with both men. Von Phul had been blackmailing her with love letters; Henwood intervened. The scandal dominated Denver newspapers for months. Henwood became a celebrity in jail, receiving flowers from admirers and dining on specially prepared meals in "Millionaire\'s Row." He was eventually convicted, but the trial revealed the rot beneath Denver\'s gilded surface. The bar where it happened is still open.',

Rockefeller\'s Colorado Fuel and Iron Company attacked a tent colony of striking miners and their families in Ludlow, 180 miles south of Denver. The miners had been on strike since September 1913, evicted from company towns and living in UMWA-provided tents. That day, soldiers soaked the tents in kerosene and set them ablaze. Eleven children and two women were found burned and suffocated in a cellar they\'d dug to escape the gunfire. In total, approximately 21 people died. The massacre triggered a ten-day armed uprising across a 225-mile front. Five thousand people demonstrated on the State Capitol lawn demanding the guardsmen be tried for murder. The Rocky Mountain News coined the term "Ludlow Massacre." No soldiers were ever convicted. Rockefeller\'s money paid no price.',

Fifty Mint Police inside the building returned fire, hitting one robber in the jaw. The gang escaped in 90 seconds. An abandoned garage on Gilpin Street later yielded the getaway car and the body of Nicholas Trainor, killed by his own crew.

He lived there for six months, then sold it for reasons he never explained—his mother had died there shortly after his wife. By the 1970s it was an office building that couldn\'t keep tenants: typewriters typed by themselves at night, party noises came from empty closets, babies cried from the third floor. During 1970s renovations, construction crews grew so frustrated with arriving to find their work undone that they brought in guard dogs. The next morning, both Dobermans were found dead on the sidewalk—they had apparently leapt from a third-floor window. The mansion is now a bed-and-breakfast called the Patterson Inn.

            title: 'Riverdale Road: Colorado\'s Gates of Hell',
            body: 'An 11-mile stretch between Thornton and Brighton has collected more paranormal legends than any road in Colorado. The "Gates of Hell" refer to iron gates marking where the Wolpert Mansion once stood—according to legend, a man burned it down with his family inside after becoming possessed. (The mansion was real; the fire happened in the 1970s when it was already abandoned.) Jogger\'s Hill near 120th Avenue is haunted by a phantom runner killed in a hit-and-run—locals say if you let him approach your driver\'s side window, you\'ll die. Drivers report a spectral Camaro that challenges them to race. An old dairy supposedly has a tree where accused witches were hanged. Warning signs have allegedly appeared reading "Hitchhikers May Be Demons." Ghost hunters report cold spots, strange feelings, and equipment malfunctions. Drive it if you dare.',
            verdict: 'Multiple documented legends. Phantom runner. Demon hitchhikers. Your move.',

            body: 'Denver International Airport opened in 1995, $2 billion over budget and 16 months late. The delays were blamed on the failed automated baggage system—or, depending on who you ask, construction of secret underground bunkers for the global elite. The Masonic dedication capstone dated March 19, 1994 mentions the "New World Airport Commission." The murals by Leo Tanguma depict soldiers in gas masks, burning forests, and dead children. The gargoyles in baggage claim emerge from actual suitcases. There are at least six underground levels. The airport sits on 53 square miles—twice the size of Manhattan—with runways arranged in a shape some call a swastika. All of this is true. What\'s not confirmed: Illuminati headquarters, lizard people, apocalypse bunkers, or tunnels connecting to NORAD. The airport leans in, posting signs during construction: "Apologies for the noise. It takes really big drills to get to the underworld."',
            verdict: 'The airport officially embraces the theories. They sell conspiracy merchandise. Make of that what you will.',
