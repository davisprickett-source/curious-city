            body: 'On Halloween night 1880, a pool game argument at John Asmussen\'s saloon on Wazee Street became the pretext for Denver\'s first race riot. A mob of 3,000 descended on Hop Alley—the Chinese neighborhood near present-day Coors Field—beating residents and destroying every business. Look Young, a 28-year-old who had lived in Denver for just six months, was dragged from Sing Lee\'s laundry, had his queue cut off, was beaten and tortured, then hanged from a lamppost. He died of his injuries. The rioters caused $53,655 in damage (over $1.5 million today). No one was ever convicted. The Chinese consul\'s request for reparations was denied. Chinatown never recovered, and the survivors never received compensation. In 2022, Denver formally apologized—142 years later.',
            verdict: 'The city apologized in 2022. The original site is now a parking lot near the ballpark.',

            body: 'Cheesman Park is one of Denver\'s most beloved green spaces—80 acres of manicured lawns where joggers run and couples picnic. It\'s also a mass grave. The land was Mount Prospect Cemetery from 1858 to 1890, filled primarily with paupers, criminals, and smallpox victims from the nearby "pest house." When the city decided to convert it to a park, families were given 90 days to claim their dead. Most bodies went unclaimed. The city hired undertaker E.P. McGovern to relocate the remaining 5,000+ corpses at $1.90 each. McGovern found a shortcut: he hacked the bodies apart and stuffed them into child-sized coffins, sometimes using three caskets for one adult. When the Denver Republican exposed "The Work Of Ghouls!" the city fired McGovern—but never hired anyone else. To this day, an estimated 2,000-3,000 bodies remain beneath the park. Construction crews still unearth bones regularly; four well-preserved skeletons were found as recently as 2010.',
            verdict: 'Bodies are still found during construction. The park inspired elements of "Poltergeist."',

On May 24, 1911, it became the scene of high-society murder. Frank Henwood shot Sylvester "Tony" von Phul three times in the Marble Bar, killing him and accidentally killing bystander George Copeland. The trigger was a love triangle involving socialite Isabel Springer, who lived at the hotel with her millionaire husband while carrying on affairs with both men. Von Phul had been blackmailing her with love letters; Henwood intervened. The scandal dominated Denver newspapers for months. Henwood became a celebrity in jail, receiving flowers from admirers and dining on specially prepared meals in "Millionaire\'s Row." He was eventually convicted but the trial revealed the rot beneath Denver\'s gilded surface.',

Rockefeller\'s Colorado Fuel and Iron Company attacked a tent colony of striking miners and their families in Ludlow, 180 miles south of Denver. The miners had been on strike since September 1913, evicted from company towns and living in UMWA-provided tents. That day, soldiers soaked the tents in kerosene and set them ablaze. Eleven children and two women were found burned and suffocated in a cellar they\'d dug to escape the gunfire. In total, approximately 21 people died. The massacre triggered a ten-day armed uprising across a 225-mile front. Five thousand people demonstrated on the State Capitol lawn demanding the guardsmen be tried for murder. The Rocky Mountain News coined the term "Ludlow Massacre." No soldiers were ever convicted.',

Fifty Mint Police inside the building returned fire, hitting one robber in the jaw. The gang escaped in 90 seconds. An abandoned garage on Gilpin Street later yielded the getaway car and the body of Nicholas Trainor, killed by his own crew.

            body: 'The 32-foot blue mustang with glowing red eyes that greets arrivals at Denver International Airport is nicknamed "Blucifer" for good reason. In 2006, a section of the sculpture fell from a hoist in artist Luis Jiménez\'s New Mexico studio, severing an artery in his leg. He bled to death on the studio floor. The piece was commissioned in 1992 for $300,000 but wasn\'t installed until 2008, two years after Jiménez\'s death—his sons and studio assistants completed it from his detailed plans. The demonic interpretation that locals have embraced contradicts the artist\'s intent: Jiménez designed the blue color as tribute to lowrider culture, the eyes as homage to his father\'s neon sign shop. But the death, the eyes, the stance—it all feeds into DIA\'s conspiracy mythology. The airport now sells Blucifer merchandise. His estate wishes you wouldn\'t call it that.',
            verdict: 'Luis Jiménez died before completion. The sculpture stands as commissioned.',

The delays were blamed on the failed automated baggage system—or, depending on who you ask, construction of secret underground bunkers for the global elite. The Masonic dedication capstone dated March 19, 1994 mentions the "New World Airport Commission." The murals by Leo Tanguma depict soldiers in gas masks, burning forests, and dead children. The gargoyles in baggage claim emerge from actual suitcases. There are at least six underground levels. The airport sits on 53 square miles—twice the size of Manhattan—with runways arranged in a shape some call a swastika. All of this is true. What\'s not confirmed: Illuminati headquarters, lizard people, apocalypse bunkers, or tunnels connecting to NORAD. The airport has leaned in, posting signs during construction reading: "Apologies for the noise. It takes really big drills to get to the underworld."',

He lived there for six months, then sold it for reasons he never explained—his mother had died there shortly after his wife. By the 1970s it was an office building that couldn\'t keep tenants: typewriters typed by themselves at night, party noises came from empty closets, babies cried from the third floor. During 1970s renovations, construction crews grew so frustrated with arriving to find their work undone that they brought in guard dogs. The next morning, both Dobermans were found dead on the sidewalk—they had apparently leapt from a third-floor window. The mansion is now a bed-and-breakfast called the Patterson Inn.

First he said the men had died and he\'d eaten them to survive. Then he blamed Shannon Bell for killing everyone before Packer shot him in self-defense. Five hatchet-marked bodies were eventually found. Packer escaped jail and spent eight years on the run before being captured. He was sentenced to death (later reduced to 40 years) and became a morbid celebrity. The Denver Post championed his innocence in the 1890s, and after his 1901 parole, he worked as a guard at the Post. He died peacefully in Littleton in 1907. 1989 forensic examination suggested homicide. A 1990s study of his pistol suggested innocence. The truth died with Packer.',
