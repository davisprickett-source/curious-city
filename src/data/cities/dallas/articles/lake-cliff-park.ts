  title: 'The Coney Island Dallas Forgot',
  subtitle: 'Lake Cliff Park was once the largest amusement park in the Southwest — 65 acres of roller coasters, natatoriums, and vaudeville theaters. By 1930, it was gone. Today, almost nobody in Dallas knows it existed. The lake is still there. The memories are not.',
  excerpt: 'In the early 1900s, Lake Cliff Park was the entertainment capital of Dallas. Roller coasters looped over a spring-fed lake. A massive natatorium drew thousands of swimmers. Vaudeville shows packed the pavilion. For three decades, Lake Cliff was where Dallas went to have fun. Then the Depression came, the park closed, and Dallas erased it from memory. Today, a quiet city park sits where the roller coasters once ran. Almost nothing marks what was lost.',

There were roller coasters — multiple roller coasters — twisting above a spring-fed lake. A natatorium the size of a cathedral held 3,000 swimmers. Vaudeville performers played the pavilion. A miniature railroad circled the grounds. Bands played. Children screamed. For a nickel, you could escape your ordinary life and spend a day in the Coney Island of the Southwest.',

It was the age of the great amusement parks — Coney Island in New York, Riverview in Chicago — and Mangold wanted Dallas to have its own.',
