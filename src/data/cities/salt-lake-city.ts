        intro: 'Salt Lake City was built on prophecy and isolation—a theocratic settlement carved into hostile desert, far from federal reach. That isolation bred both community and darkness. The same mountains that promised refuge have witnessed massacres, serial killers, fundamentalist murders, and disappearances where the desert keeps its secrets. Utah ranks ninth nationally in serial killer victims per capita. The faith that built Zion has also, at its fringes, justified bloodshed. And the West Desert, with its abandoned mines and salt flats, offers endless places to hide what should never be found.',

The emigrants, bound for California from Arkansas, had been besieged for five days before militia leaders approached under a white flag, promising safe passage. Once disarmed, the emigrants were led away in small groups and executed. Only 17 children—those young enough that they wouldn\'t remember—were spared. The massacre occurred during the Utah War, when Mormon settlers feared federal invasion. For twenty years, LDS leadership blamed Paiutes. Only one man, John D. Lee, was ever prosecuted. He was executed by firing squad at the massacre site in 1877, seated on his own coffin. In 2007, the LDS Church expressed "profound regret" but stopped short of an official apology.',

What happened next became one of the most sadistic crimes in Utah history. Dale Pierre Selby and William Andrews forced their victims to drink caustic drain cleaner (Drano), then taped their mouths shut to prevent vomiting. When the poison didn\'t kill them, Pierre kicked a ballpoint pen into one victim\'s ear, lodging it in his brain. He raped 18-year-old Michelle Ansley, then shot all five in the head. Three died: Stanley Walker (20), Michelle Ansley (18), and Carol Naisbitt (52). Two survived with permanent damage. Pierre was executed in 1987. Andrews\' case drew controversy—he hadn\'t pulled the trigger, and a juror had passed a note with a racial slur during sentencing. Despite NAACP and Amnesty International campaigns, he was executed in 1992.',

Melissa Smith, 17, daughter of a Midvale police chief, disappeared October 18. Bundy was first arrested in Salt Lake City on August 16, 1975, after a highway patrol officer noticed him driving with his headlights off and found a ski mask, handcuffs, and a crowbar in his VW Beetle. He was convicted of kidnapping Carol DaRonch, who had escaped his car. Utah\'s arrest led to his extradition to Colorado, his escape, and eventually his Florida murders. Before his 1989 execution, Bundy confessed to at least 30 killings—but Utah investigators believe there are more victims in the West Desert who were never found.',

Both victims were young fathers. Gilmore was captured the same week, tried, and sentenced to death. Then he did something unprecedented: he demanded to be executed. For ten years, capital punishment had been frozen in America. Gilmore wanted to restart it. When the ACLU and his mother fought to save his life, he wrote: "It\'s my life and it\'s my death." On January 17, 1977, Gilmore was strapped to a chair in an abandoned cannery behind Utah State Prison. Five police officers aimed through holes in a curtain. Asked for last words, he said: "Let\'s do it." He became the first person executed in America in a decade. Nike\'s Dan Wieden later adapted those words into "Just Do It."',

            body: 'Arthur Gary Bishop was the perfect Utah boy—Eagle Scout, honor student, returned LDS missionary. He was excommunicated for embezzlement, changed his name to Roger Downs, and joined the Big Brothers program. Between 1979 and 1983, he abducted and murdered five boys aged 4 to 13 in Salt Lake County. He kept souvenirs. He took photographs. When arrested in 1983, he confessed immediately and led police to the remains. Bishop showed no emotion during his trial, describing his crimes in clinical detail. He was executed by lethal injection on June 10, 1988, at Utah State Prison. His case exposed how a predator could hide behind institutional trust—and prompted reforms in how organizations screen volunteers who work with children.',
            verdict: 'Five boys murdered. Bishop executed. His case changed background check requirements for youth organizations.',

Brenda Lafferty, their sister-in-law, opened the door. Ron strangled her with a vacuum cord while Dan cut her throat. Then Dan killed 15-month-old Erica in her crib. Ron claimed God had commanded the murders in a revelation. Brenda, he said, had encouraged his wife to leave him after he embraced polygamy. The brothers had founded a fundamentalist splinter group called the School of the Prophets. They were arrested two weeks later at a casino buffet in Reno. Dan received life without parole. Ron was sentenced to death but died of natural causes in 2019, still awaiting execution. Jon Krakauer\'s "Under the Banner of Heaven" documented the case, later adapted into an FX series starring Andrew Garfield.',

Her husband Josh said he\'d taken their sons, ages 2 and 4, on a midnight camping trip in the West Desert—in December, below freezing. Susan, he claimed, stayed home. Police found blood on the floor, insurance policies worth $1.5 million, and a letter from Susan saying she feared for her life. Josh never wavered from his camping story. Investigators believed he killed Susan and disposed of her body in the desert. They couldn\'t prove it. In February 2012, during a supervised custody visit, Josh locked a social worker out, attacked his sons with a hatchet, and ignited a fire that killed all three. His brother Michael, suspected of helping dispose of Susan\'s body, killed himself a year later. Susan\'s remains have never been found. The podcast "Cold" has kept the case alive, and her family still searches the West Desert.',

Police released a composite sketch of a Hispanic man seen in the area. Twenty-five years later, Rosie\'s parents still haven\'t given up.

His shack was destroyed, apparently converted into a raft. Did he drown? Did he escape? In 1890, hunters found a headless skeleton in shackles on the lake\'s eastern shore. Authorities insisted Jean Baptiste was never chained. The mystery remains unsolved. Ghost hunters say Baptiste still wanders Antelope Island, searching for something—or someone—in the dark.',

According to legend, a woman in a purple dress died on the platform in the 1920s after a lover\'s quarrel—she either fell or was pushed in front of a train. Since then, the Purple Lady has been seen wandering the halls, standing at the end of the platform, appearing in her elegant dress to startle late-night workers. The building now houses state history offices and the Utah History Research Center. Employees report cold spots, unexplained sounds, and glimpses of a woman in purple moving through the corridors at night.',
            verdict: 'The depot is open to the public. The Purple Lady is not on the docent schedule but appears anyway.',

            body: 'In the Salt Lake City Cemetery, section X1, a modest headstone marks the grave of Lilly E. Gray (1881–1958). Beneath her name, someone carved a message that has baffled visitors for decades: "Victim of the Beast 666." No one knows what it means. Lilly led an unremarkable life—married to Elmer Gray, a drifter with a long criminal record who had been imprisoned multiple times. He likely wrote the inscription, though he never explained it. Was it a reference to the Book of Revelation? A protest against the government? A husband\'s private grief encoded in apocalyptic language? Elmer died in 1963 and took the answer with him. Visitors still leave pennies on Lilly\'s grave, trying to appease whatever darkness the inscription suggests.',
            verdict: 'The meaning died with Elmer Gray. The grave remains one of Utah\'s strangest landmarks.',
