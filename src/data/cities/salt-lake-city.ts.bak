            title: 'The Lafferty Murders: Revelation and Slaughter',
            body: 'On July 24, 1984—Pioneer Day, Utah\'s most sacred holiday—Ron and Dan Lafferty drove to their brother\'s home in American Fork. Brenda Lafferty, their sister-in-law, opened the door. Ron strangled her with a vacuum cord while Dan cut her throat. Then Dan killed 15-month-old Erica in her crib. Ron claimed God had commanded the murders in a revelation. Brenda, he said, had encouraged his wife to leave him after he embraced polygamy. The brothers had founded a fundamentalist splinter group called the School of the Prophets. They were arrested two weeks later at a casino buffet in Reno. Dan received life without parole. Ron was sentenced to death but died of natural causes in 2019, still awaiting execution. Jon Krakauer\'s "Under the Banner of Heaven" documented the case, later adapted into an FX series starring Andrew Garfield.',
            verdict: 'A mother and infant murdered in the name of revelation. The case exposed dangerous fault lines between mainstream and fundamentalist Mormonism.',

            body: 'On December 6, 2009, Susan Powell vanished from her West Valley City home. Her husband Josh said he\'d taken their sons, ages 2 and 4, on a midnight camping trip in the West Desert—in December, below freezing. Susan, he claimed, stayed home. Police found blood on the floor, insurance policies worth $1.5 million, and a letter from Susan saying she feared for her life. Josh never wavered from his camping story. Investigators believed he killed Susan and disposed of her body in the desert. They couldn\'t prove it. In February 2012, during a supervised custody visit, Josh locked a social worker out, attacked his sons with a hatchet, and ignited a fire that killed all three. His brother Michael, suspected of helping dispose of Susan\'s body, killed himself a year later. Susan\'s remains have never been found. The podcast "Cold" has kept the case alive, and her family still searches the West Desert.',
            verdict: 'Susan Powell declared legally dead in 2012. Her body has never been recovered. The West Desert keeps its secrets.',

Six-year-old Rosie Tapia was taken from her bed. Her body was found the next morning, floating in a canal bordering the apartment complex. Police released a composite sketch of a Hispanic man seen in the area. Twenty-five years later, Rosie\'s parents still haven\'t given up. DNA evidence exists but has never matched anyone in databases. The case remains Salt Lake City\'s most haunting child murder—a little girl taken from her own bed while her family slept.',

He had stripped hundreds of corpses. The city, horrified, tattooed his forehead, branded his face, and banished him to Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake. Six weeks later, he had vanished. His shack was destroyed, apparently converted into a raft. Did he drown? Did he escape? In 1890, hunters found a headless skeleton in shackles on the lake\'s eastern shore. Authorities insisted Jean Baptiste was never chained. The mystery remains unsolved. Ghost hunters say Baptiste still wanders Antelope Island, searching for something—or someone—in the dark.',

Since then, the Purple Lady has been seen wandering the halls, standing at the end of the platform, appearing in her elegant dress to startle late-night workers. The building now houses state history offices and the Utah History Research Center. Employees report cold spots, unexplained sounds, and glimpses of a woman in purple moving through the corridors at night.',

Beneath her name, someone carved a message that has baffled visitors for decades: "Victim of the Beast 666." No one knows what it means. Lilly led an unremarkable life—married to Elmer Gray, a drifter with a long criminal record who had been imprisoned multiple times. He likely wrote the inscription, though he never explained it. Was it a reference to the Book of Revelation? A protest against the government? A husband\'s private grief encoded in apocalyptic language? Elmer died in 1963 and took the answer with him. Visitors still leave pennies on Lilly\'s grave, trying to appease whatever darkness the inscription suggests.',
