        teaser: 'Where predators thrive and victims vanish',
        intro: 'Alaska has the highest rate of serial killings per capita in the nation—15.65 per million inhabitants. The vastness of the wilderness, sparse law enforcement, transient population, and months of darkness create conditions where predators thrive and victims vanish. Anchorage, as the state\'s largest city, has been home to some of America\'s most methodical killers.',

            body: 'Robert Hansen, a respected Anchorage baker and family man, kidnapped, raped, and murdered at least 17 women over twelve years. His method was horrifyingly recreational: he would fly victims in his private plane to remote wilderness locations, release them, and hunt them like game with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle. Most victims were dancers and sex workers from Fourth Avenue clubs—women Hansen believed nobody would miss. Only 12 bodies have ever been recovered.',
            verdict: 'Captured in 1983 after Cindy Paulson escaped. Sentenced to 461 years. Died in prison in 2014.',
