Between 1971 and 1984, it housed approximately 30 nightclubs, shops, and restaurants, becoming a legendary venue for the early punk and alternative scene. The complex hosted iconic acts like The Ramones, The Police, Iggy Pop, Sonic Youth, Pat Benatar, Steve Martin, and George Carlin. The entrance had a New York City subway-style design with paintings of trains. Author David Sedaris, who spent his high school years in Raleigh, remembered thinking "This is what New York is like!" The venue closed in 1984 due to safety and fire code concerns. While there have been occasional discussions about a revival, the space remains largely a piece of Raleigh\'s underground history.',
