            body: 'Longfellow\'s "Song of Hiawatha" made Minnehaha Falls famous, drawing crowds by the thousands. But the area around the falls became something else entirely — a strip of saloons, gambling dens, and what newspapers delicately called "ladies of the night." Class tensions exploded over whether the falls should become a public park or remain in private hands profiting from vice. The city finally seized and razed the buildings in 1906, erasing the "wicked midway" and creating the pastoral park that exists today.',

            body: 'Velma Barfield looked like someone\'s grandmother. She was. She was also a serial killer who poisoned at least four people—including her own mother—with arsenic-laced drinks, killing them slowly over days while "nursing" them. Her final victim, boyfriend Stuart Taylor, died in February 1978 after she feared he\'d discovered her check forgery. She blamed her addiction to tranquilizers and painkillers. On death row, Barfield became a devout Christian, ministering to other prisoners and earning the support of Billy Graham, who pleaded for clemency. Governor Jim Hunt, facing re-election, refused. On November 2, 1984, Velma Barfield became the first woman executed in America in 22 years. Her last meal was Cheez Doodles and Coca-Cola. Her final statement apologized to "everybody who has gone through a lot of pain."',

Doors were double-locked. The media called it the most terrifying year in Raleigh history. In 1997, John Williams Jr., a homeless man, was arrested and eventually sentenced to death for two of the murders—Patricia Ashe and Deborah Elliot. But the case fractured: Leman Evans was convicted separately for killing Dewanna Burt. Three victims—Dawn Grandy, Cynthia Brown, and Patricia Woods—remain unsolved. Williams, now in his late 50s, still sits on death row at Central Prison. The year of fear ended, but the questions didn\'t.',

It was once the center of a 5,000-acre plantation where over 100 enslaved people lived and died. Today, it\'s haunted. Mary Willis Mordecai Turk is the most famous spirit—seen playing the piano in period dress, appearing as a floating orb near the instrument she loved. Paranormal investigators have documented cold spots, unexplained sounds, and a pervasive sense of grief on the staircase where, legend says, a baby died after being scalded in a bath. The Ghost Guild has been the park\'s official paranormal research team since 2017, presenting findings every October.

A night watchman who worked there for 15 years reported screaming, slamming doors, books crashing in the third-floor library, breaking glass, jingling keys, and footsteps on stone floors—all while the building was empty. The manually-operated elevator ran up and down on its own. In 1981, a curator working late encountered an apparition in the doorway of the committee room off the senate chamber. The figure dissolved. The smell of cigar smoke appears without explanation. A shadow figure moves near the Governor\'s Office—believed by some to be Zebulon Vance, the Civil War governor who fled as Sherman approached. The Capitol\'s underground escape tunnels, built during the Civil War, add to the building\'s unease.',

She died unexpectedly in 1918 at 38 years old. According to local lore, at midnight every Halloween, the angel\'s head spins twelve times. Some claim the carved stone eyes follow you as you move. Visitors report being pushed, scratched, and shoved. In the Confederate section, sounds of gunshots and shouting echo across the graves. The cemetery added the grounds to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The dead, apparently, take no notice of such honors.',

Thomas Briggs supposedly built it with gold and silver coins he\'d buried before Union soldiers arrived, digging for years after the war to find them. The building housed the city\'s first YMCA, its first Catholic Church, and the Raleigh Little Theatre. Now it\'s the City of Raleigh Museum.

            description: 'A cabinet of curiosities masquerading as an antique shop, or maybe the other way around. Taxidermy and skulls share space with Victorian medical equipment, vintage taxidermy supplies, and items whose original purpose remains mysterious. The owner is knowledgeable about the provenance of the bones and pelts, which is both reassuring and slightly unsettling. This isn\'t the kind of place that cares about Yelp reviews or accessibility — you want a fox skull or a jar of glass eyes, they have them; you want a warm shopping experience, go to Target. The Andersonville location means you can pair your macabre shopping with excellent coffee and Swedish pancakes, which is the kind of juxtaposition that makes Chicago interesting. Is this ethically complicated? Probably. Is it fascinating? Absolutely. Every object has a story, and the owner knows most of them.',

Three weeks later, their naked bodies were found along a desolate road in Willow Springs. Despite one of the largest investigations in Chicago history — including a personal plea from Elvis himself — and numerous false confessions, no one was ever charged. The case file remains open. Multiple podcasts have covered this haunting case, including "Morbid" (Episode 515), "Most Notorious!" with historian Troy Taylor, and "Voices for Justice." The case is also featured in "Ontario Cold Cases" podcast.',

            body: 'On July 24, 1984—Pioneer Day, Utah\'s most sacred holiday—Ron and Dan Lafferty drove to their brother\'s home in American Fork. Brenda Lafferty, their sister-in-law, opened the door. Ron strangled her with a vacuum cord while Dan cut her throat. Then Dan killed 15-month-old Erica in her crib. Ron claimed God had commanded the murders in a revelation. Brenda, he said, had encouraged his wife to leave him after he embraced polygamy. The brothers had founded a fundamentalist splinter group called the School of the Prophets. They were arrested two weeks later at a casino buffet in Reno. Dan received life without parole. Ron was sentenced to death but died of natural causes in 2019, still awaiting execution. Jon Krakauer\'s "Under the Banner of Heaven" documented the case, later adapted into an FX series starring Andrew Garfield.',
            verdict: 'A mother and infant murdered in the name of revelation. The case exposed dangerous fault lines between mainstream and fundamentalist Mormonism.',

Police found blood on the floor, insurance policies worth $1.5 million, and a letter from Susan saying she feared for her life. Josh never wavered from his camping story. Investigators believed he killed Susan and disposed of her body in the desert. They couldn\'t prove it. In February 2012, during a supervised custody visit, Josh locked a social worker out, attacked his sons with a hatchet, and ignited a fire that killed all three. His brother Michael, suspected of helping dispose of Susan\'s body, killed himself a year later. Susan\'s remains have never been found. The podcast "Cold" has kept the case alive, and her family still searches the West Desert.',

His shack was destroyed, apparently converted into a raft. Did he drown? Did he escape? In 1890, hunters found a headless skeleton in shackles on the lake\'s eastern shore.

Lilly led an unremarkable life—married to Elmer Gray, a drifter with a long criminal record who had been imprisoned multiple times. He likely wrote the inscription, though he never explained it. Was it a reference to the Book of Revelation? A protest against the government? A husband\'s private grief encoded in apocalyptic language? Elmer died in 1963 and took the answer with him.

            body: 'On September 17, 1991, 13-year-old Heather Dawn Church was babysitting her younger brother at their Black Forest home when she was abducted. Despite extensive searches, her body wasn\'t found until September 16, 1993 — exactly two years later — when a transient camper discovered her remains on Rampart Range Road, 30 miles away. She had died from blunt force trauma. Three fingerprints on a window screen led police to Robert Charles Browne, who lived half a mile away. He was convicted in 1995 and later claimed to have killed 48 people across multiple states, though he\'s only been convicted of two murders. Heather\'s case was covered on True Crime Garage podcast.',

The soldiers killed at least 230 people—mostly women, children, and the elderly—then mutilated the bodies and paraded trophies through Denver streets to cheering crowds. A Congressional investigation later condemned it as a "foul and dastardly massacre," but Chivington was never prosecuted. The violence at Sand Creek triggered decades of warfare across the Great Plains and shattered any remaining trust between indigenous peoples and the federal government.

The land was Mount Prospect Cemetery from 1858 to 1890, filled primarily with paupers, criminals, and smallpox victims from the nearby "pest house." When the city decided to convert it to a park, families were given 90 days to claim their dead. Most bodies went unclaimed. The city hired undertaker E.P. McGovern to relocate the remaining 5,000+ corpses at $1.90 each. McGovern found a shortcut: he hacked the bodies apart and stuffed them into child-sized coffins, sometimes using three caskets for one adult. When the Denver Republican exposed "The Work Of Ghouls!" the city fired McGovern—but never hired anyone else. To this day, an estimated 2,000-3,000 bodies remain beneath the park. Construction crews still unearth bones regularly; four well-preserved skeletons were found as recently as 2010.

When police found him the next morning, he wore a clean pressed shirt—though beneath it, his body was smeared with blood. He couldn\'t explain what had happened. The media dubbed him the "Dream Slayer" and blamed marijuana, transforming Licata into the poster child for Harry Anslinger\'s anti-cannabis crusade and the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act. The truth was simpler and sadder: Licata had been diagnosed with dementia praecox (schizophrenia) before the murders, and his family had a documented history of hereditary mental illness—his parents were first cousins, one brother was schizophrenic, and multiple relatives had been institutionalized. Cannabis was never mentioned in his psychiatric records. Licata escaped from the Florida Hospital for the Insane in 1945, was recaptured with help from a cousin in New Orleans, and hanged himself on December 4, 1950.',

Ronald Felton, 60, was shot in the back on November 14 while walking to church to feed the homeless. The victims had nothing in common except that they were walking alone at night within a half-mile radius. Police flooded the neighborhood, warning residents not to go outside alone. On November 28, Howell Emanuel Donaldson III handed a McDonald\'s manager a bag containing a pistol and told her to bury it without looking inside. She called police. Ballistics matched the gun to all four murders. Donaldson, a former college basketball player with no apparent motive, pleaded guilty in 2023 and received four consecutive life sentences.',
            verdict: 'Four dead, one killer, no motive ever established. The McDonald\'s manager who turned him in received the $110,000 reward.',

Theodore Roosevelt, the Queen of England, and Babe Ruth all stayed there. The hotel failed to turn a profit and became the University of Tampa in 1933. Now students and faculty report flickering lights, objects moving on their own, and footsteps in empty hallways at night. Most disturbing is "The Brown Man"—a figure in a brown suit with long white hair and glowing red eyes who appears in corridors and classrooms. Those who acknowledge his presence say he rushes toward them, face-to-face, then vanishes. Paranormal investigators believe it\'s Henry Plant himself, unable to leave his creation. Others report Bessie, a performer who killed herself after catching her husband with a castmate during a hotel stay. Her ghost lingers in the upper rooms, forever heartbroken.',

The Travel Channel named it one of the Top 10 Most Haunted Places in America. Visitors report figures following them through empty halls, cold spots in the ballroom, and the distinct sense of being watched from the theater balcony.

But the theater\'s strangest haunting is confined to a single seat—number 308—where a man in a fedora has been spotted sitting through screenings. When approached, he vanishes. Paranormal investigators have captured audio and video anomalies concentrated on that seat. No one knows who he is or why he keeps coming back. The theater still shows films.

They were given American names, forced into uniforms, their hair cut short. Physical punishment was common for infractions as small as speaking a native word. Children were used as labor for local farms and businesses. Disease swept through the crowded dormitories—in January 1900 alone, measles killed nine children in ten days. Students who ran away sometimes died trying to reach home. When the school finally closed in 1990, departing students carved their names into the walls to prove they had existed.

At Union Station, a baggage handler noticed the trunks were leaking and smelled foul. Police met the train. Judd fled, then surrendered at a funeral home five days later. The press dubbed her the "Trunk Murderess," the "Tiger Woman," and the "Blonde Butcher." She claimed self-defense—all three women had been shot, including her. She was sentenced to hang, but days before execution was declared insane and transferred to the Arizona State Mental Hospital. Over 38 years, she escaped seven times.

            body: 'In the summer of 2005, Phoenix faced something unprecedented: two serial killers hunting simultaneously. The Baseline Killer—later identified as Mark Goudeau—terrorized neighborhoods near Baseline Road, raping, robbing, and murdering women. He killed nine people and sexually assaulted fifteen before his capture in 2006. At the same time, the Serial Shooters—Dale Hausner and Samuel Dieteman—were conducting what Dieteman later called "random recreational violence." They drove through Phoenix neighborhoods at night, shooting pedestrians, cyclists, dogs, and horses. Eight people died; nineteen were wounded. Hausner told police it was "fun." Local media dubbed it the "Summer of Fear"—a city paralyzed by the knowledge that two unconnected predators were hunting its streets. Goudeau remains on death row. Hausner was executed in 2012. Dieteman received life in prison.',

Phoenix Police received over 3,300 tips. In April 2017, they arrested Aaron Juan Saucedo, a former city bus driver. His first victim had been his mother\'s boyfriend—shot in August 2015.

An unsheltered person in Phoenix has 200 to 300 times the risk of heat death compared to the general population.

Her suicide note blamed an abusive boyfriend. Ever since, guests and staff have reported seeing a woman in white standing at the penthouse window, crying heard from empty rooms, and a ghostly presence on the seventh floor. The hotel was built on the site of a former school; children are said to run through the halls at night.

Their bodies were dumped in Forest Park, the 5,200-acre urban wilderness that Portlanders consider a crown jewel. Todd Alan Reed targeted women living on the margins—invisible victims in a city that prided itself on livability. Reed was arrested after DNA linked him to all three murders. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2000, though Oregon\'s death penalty has been under moratorium since 2011. The case exposed how vulnerable Portland\'s homeless population was—and how easy it was for a predator to hunt them without notice. Forest Park\'s trails, beloved by joggers and hikers, had become a dumping ground.',

His stepmother, Terri Horman, was the last person to see him alive. He vanished. The search that followed was the largest in Oregon history—1,300 searchers, ten days, no trace. Terri failed two polygraph tests. A judge later called her a "prime suspect." Investigators learned she had offered the family landscaper money to kill her husband months before Kyron disappeared. She has never been charged. Fifteen years later, Kyron\'s whereabouts remain unknown. Over 4,000 tips have come in from around the world. A $50,000 reward remains unclaimed.

It was also a primary site for shanghaiing—drunken sailors were kidnapped from the bar and sold to ship captains through the basement. Today, the White Eagle is McMenamins\' most haunted property. Two ghosts have become so familiar they have names: Sam, a pre-Prohibition bartender, and Rose, a woman of uncertain history—perhaps a prostitute held captive in the basement, perhaps a worker murdered and discovered by her lover.

The home was decades ahead of its time: central vacuum, intercom system, walk-in refrigerator, elevator. Henry died in 1919; Georgiana followed in 1918. Since then, visitors have reported phantom footsteps, objects moving on their own, and the unmistakable scent of Georgiana\'s favorite rose wafting through empty rooms. Some have seen the Pittocks walking hand-in-hand through the gardens. Others have spotted Georgiana standing in an upstairs window, watching the city she helped build.

But 10,000 of those graves are unmarked and unknown. Dr. James Hawthorne, who ran the Oregon Asylum for the Insane with unusual compassion, is buried alongside 185 of his patients. In 2007, an archaeological dig uncovered 50 more asylum patients who had been forgotten. Among the cemetery\'s notable residents is Charity Lamb, the first woman convicted of murder in Oregon Territory—she buried an axe in her husband\'s skull at the dinner table in 1854.
