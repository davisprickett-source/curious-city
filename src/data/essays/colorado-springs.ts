          content: 'General William Jackson Palmer founded Colorado Springs in 1871 as a resort town for wealthy tuberculosis patients, a place where the dry mountain air and sunshine might cure what medicine could not. He was a Quaker, a teetotaler, a railroad man who had made his fortune building the Denver & Rio Grande Western, and he imagined his city as a genteel alternative to the mining towns that scarred the mountains — no saloons, no gambling, no industry, just health and cultivation and views of Pikes Peak. The city he built was nicknamed "Little London" for its English expatriates and its aspirations to refinement.',

          content: 'What Palmer could not have imagined was that his resort town would become the evangelical Vatican of America, a headquarters for conservative Christianity that shapes national politics from the shadow of the mountain. Focus on the Family moved here in 1991, bringing 1,300 employees and a media empire that reaches millions. The city now hosts hundreds of Christian ministries, parachurch organizations, and missionary sending agencies. The Air Force Academy, built in the 1950s with its famous aluminum chapel pointing skyward, adds a military conservatism to the religious kind. Colorado Springs is where American Christianity and American militarism meet and mingle and reinforce each other.',

          content: 'Pikes Peak rises 14,115 feet above sea level, dominating the western horizon, visible from a hundred miles out on the plains. Katharine Lee Bates wrote "America the Beautiful" after reaching the summit in 1893, gazing down at the fruited plain and amber waves of grain stretching toward Kansas. The mountain is the most visited in North America, accessible by cog railway and toll road, its summit crowded with tourists gasping in the thin air. Below the peak, the Garden of the Gods thrusts red sandstone into the sky — formations that were ancient when the mountain rose, now surrounded by a city that has grown around them.',

Schriever Space Force Base commands the GPS constellation that guides every smartphone on Earth. NORAD — the North American Aerospace Defense Command — burrows deep inside Cheyenne Mountain, monitoring the skies for nuclear attack from a bunker designed to survive a direct hit. The military is the largest employer in the region, and the city\'s politics bend toward the hawkish conservatism that military communities often produce.',

The city that Palmer imagined — cultured, peaceful, devoted to natural beauty — still exists in the hiking trails of North Cheyenne Cañon Park, in the old tuberculosis sanatoriums converted to boutique hotels, in the artsy Manitou Springs enclave at the foot of the pass. But this city coexists with another, one of megachurches and military contractors, of subdivisions spreading across the prairie and evangelical bookstores in every strip mall.',

The Olympic Training Center relocated here in 1978, drawn by the altitude that forces athletes to produce more red blood cells. Professional cyclists and runners and triathletes train on the roads and trails, their lean bodies a contrast to the suburban sprawl they navigate. The climbing at Garden of the Gods is world-class. The trails through Red Rock Canyon rival anything in Colorado. The city has two faces — the contemplative and the combative — and both look up at the same mountain.',

Colorado Springs is now the second-largest city in Colorado, sprawling north toward Denver in a corridor of development that threatens to merge the two metros into a single megacity along the Front Range. Water is the limiting factor — it always is in the West — and the city has bought water rights from farmers across the Arkansas River basin, piping it across the mountains to feed the subdivisions. The aquifer beneath the city is dropping. The snowpack that feeds the rivers is shrinking. The growth continues anyway.',

But within that conservatism, factions compete: the libertarian strain that wants government out of bedrooms and boardrooms alike, the religious conservatives who want biblical values encoded in law, the military families who want a strong defense and not much else. The Gazette runs editorials that could have been written in 1950. The Springs, as locals call it, knows what it believes, even if those beliefs sometimes contradict each other.',

The natural beauty is undeniable — the red rocks and the peak and the clean mountain light. The military-religious-industrial complex is equally undeniable, shaping the city\'s economy and politics and culture. Palmer\'s vision of a health resort has become something he could never have predicted: a city of megachurches and missile silos, of Olympic athletes and Air Force officers, of natural wonders surrounded by suburban sprawl. Pikes Peak watches it all from above, as it watched the Ute people who lived here for millennia, as it will watch whatever comes next.',
