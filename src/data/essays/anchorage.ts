They imagine glaciers and grizzlies and vast emptiness, and Anchorage has all that within a few hours\' drive, but the city itself is strip malls and chain restaurants and traffic on the Glenn Highway during rush hour. It looks like any mid-sized Western city transplanted to an impossible latitude, dropped between the Chugach Mountains and the Cook Inlet, surrounded by wilderness but functioning like it could be anywhere. This is the contradiction at the heart of Alaska\'s largest city: it exists to service the frontier while being nothing like the frontier itself.',

Alaska has the highest rate of serial killings per capita of any state in the nation—15.65 per million inhabitants. Anchorage, the state\'s largest city, has produced some of America\'s most methodical predators. The wilderness that surrounds the city, those 365 million acres of emptiness where only 160,000 have been settled by humans, offers something that killers need: a place to make people disappear.',

The colonizers brought smallpox and influenza; the 1918 epidemic devastated Dena\'ina communities so thoroughly that entire villages vanished. The survivors watched as their homeland was expropriated piece by piece—railroad right-of-ways, military installations, state parks where they were no longer permitted to practice subsistence hunting.

He opened a bakery near Merrill Field, married, had two children, became a respected small business owner who flew his own plane into the backcountry. He was also kidnapping, raping, and murdering women—at least seventeen of them between 1971 and 1983. His method was almost recreational: he would take his victims to remote locations in the wilderness, release them, and hunt them like game with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle and hunting knives.

By early 1982, Anchorage police knew something was wrong. Seven dancers had vanished since June 1980. But Hansen might never have been caught if not for Cindy Paulson, a seventeen-year-old who escaped from his car in June 1983, handcuffs still on her wrists, running to a truck driver for help. Her description led investigators to Hansen\'s plane, his house with its soundproof room, the jewelry he kept as trophies, and a map marking the locations of bodies scattered across the Alaska wilderness.',

The money attracted prostitutes, pimps, con artists, and drug dealers.

Fourth Avenue became a battleground, and the women caught in it became expendable. When they disappeared, investigations stalled.
