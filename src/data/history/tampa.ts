          content: 'Tampa is not Miami, and the distinction matters. Miami is glamorous and Latin and looks toward the Caribbean; Tampa is scrappier, more Southern, oriented toward the Gulf of Mexico and the interior of Florida. Miami has Art Deco and celebrity; Tampa has strip clubs and strip malls and a working port. The two cities exist in different Floridas, and Tampa has spent a century in Miami\'s shadow, building its own identity out of cigars and shipping and an aggressive, almost desperate boosterism.',

Hillsborough Bay and Tampa Bay create a geography of bridges and causeways, of waterfront that seems endless, of channels dredged for shipping and pleasure boats alike. The port is Florida\'s largest, handling phosphate fertilizer and citrus and cruise ships, the industrial infrastructure that makes the glamour elsewhere possible. The bay is also beautiful, particularly at sunset when the water turns copper and pink, and this beauty coexists with the industry in ways that Tampa has learned not to apologize for.',

In 1885, Vicente Martinez-Ybor moved his cigar manufacturing from Key West to a patch of scrubland east of Tampa, and within a decade the neighborhood was producing hundreds of millions of cigars annually. Cuban, Italian, and Spanish workers rolled tobacco by hand in factories where lectors read newspapers and novels aloud to pass the time. The neighborhood was radical and cosmopolitan, a polyglot community where labor organizing and anarchist politics flourished alongside mutual aid societies and social clubs.',

Ybor City emptied and deteriorated, the beautiful brick factories abandoned, the social clubs shuttered. Urban renewal threatened to bulldoze what remained. But the neighborhood survived, barely, and has been reborn as an entertainment district, the old buildings now housing clubs and restaurants, the brick streets carrying bachelor parties rather than cigar workers. The ghosts are still there if you look for them.',

Henry Plant built a Moorish palace of a hotel that still stands, trying to make Tampa a destination resort. The cigar boom followed, then the Florida land boom of the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly. The postwar era brought military bases and suburbs and snowbirds. Each cycle left its mark on the built environment, the city a palimpsest of ambitions realized and abandoned.',

This pattern repeats daily from June through September, and Floridians learn to plan around it, scheduling outdoor activities for morning, expecting the afternoon deluge.',

Tampa Bay has not taken a direct hit from a major hurricane since 1921, a century of near-misses that has allowed millions of people to build in flood zones and evacuation areas. The bay\'s shape funnels storm surge toward downtown, and models of a worst-case scenario show catastrophic flooding. The city knows this, plans for this, and continues to build along the waterfront anyway, because that\'s where people want to live and short-term profit consistently defeats long-term planning.',
