The Great Salt Lake was undrinkable, the desert hostile, the isolation total. But that was precisely the point. The Latter-day Saints had been driven from New York to Ohio to Missouri to Illinois, their prophet murdered, their temples burned. They needed somewhere no one else wanted, somewhere they could build Zion without interference. They found it in this bowl of desert between the Wasatch Mountains and the dead sea.',

Irrigation canals redirected mountain snowmelt into a grid of city blocks laid out by revelation — each block ten acres, each street 132 feet wide, wide enough for a team of oxen to turn around without cursing. The city was planned before a single building rose, a theocratic grid imposed on wilderness with the certainty of people who believed God had led them here. Temple Square became the center of everything, the Salt Lake Temple taking 40 years to build from granite hauled by ox cart from Little Cottonwood Canyon.',

The church office building rises 28 stories beside Temple Square, housing a religious bureaucracy that manages a global faith and a corporate empire — hospitals, universities, ranches, media companies, and investment funds worth somewhere north of $100 billion. The faithful pay ten percent of their income in tithing, and the institution has multiplied those tithes into an empire that would make the Vatican envious.',

The church members are now a minority within city limits, outnumbered by the transplants and apostates and never-believers who have arrived in waves. The tech industry discovered the valley, drawn by cheap land and educated workers and mountains where you can ski during lunch. The 2002 Winter Olympics announced to the world that Salt Lake was more than temple spires and missionary suits. Now the city has craft breweries and coffee shops, Pride parades and meditation studios, all the markers of secular urban life coexisting uneasily with the faith that built the place.',

Within 45 minutes of Temple Square, you can be on a chairlift at Snowbird or Alta, skiing powder that rivals anywhere in the world — "the greatest snow on earth," they call it, and for once the boosterism isn\'t hyperbole. The mountains trap the weather and the pollution, creating winter inversions where smog settles in the valley like a lid while the peaks above gleam in sunshine.',

Now the city absorbs newcomers who come for the skiing and the startups, who do not care about temple ceremonies or pioneer heritage, who are remaking Salt Lake into something its founders would not recognize and might not approve of. The temple spires still rise above downtown, the mountains still catch the morning light, and the negotiation between what Salt Lake was and what it is becoming continues in every city council meeting and real estate transaction and awkward conversation about religion.',
