The falls meant power—first for sawmills that turned the white pine forests of Minnesota into the lumber that built the Great Plains, then for flour mills that ground the wheat of the same plains into the flour that fed the cities of the East. By the 1880s Minneapolis was the flour milling capital of the world, the epicenter of an industry built on the simple physics of water dropping twenty feet through mill races and turning wheels. Pillsbury and General Mills and Gold Medal—these were not brands but geographies made corporate, the transformation of rivers and wheat fields into products that could be shipped in bags and boxes to places that had forgotten what grain looked like growing.',

It\'s a joke about dating, about the surplus of men who came north chasing oil money and adventure and something they couldn\'t name. But the joke contains a darker truth. Alaska has the highest rate of serial killings per capita of any state in the nation—15.65 per million inhabitants. Anchorage, the state\'s largest city, has produced some of America\'s most methodical predators. The wilderness that surrounds the city, those 365 million acres of emptiness where only 160,000 have been settled by humans, offers something that killers need: a place to make people disappear.',

The colonizers brought smallpox and influenza; the 1918 epidemic devastated Dena\'ina communities so thoroughly that entire villages vanished. The survivors watched as their homeland was expropriated piece by piece—railroad right-of-ways, military installations, state parks where they were no longer permitted to practice subsistence hunting.

He was also kidnapping, raping, and murdering women—at least seventeen of them between 1971 and 1983.

But Hansen might never have been caught if not for Cindy Paulson, a seventeen-year-old who escaped from his car in June 1983, handcuffs still on her wrists, running to a truck driver for help.

The settlers came in the 1840s via the Oregon Trail, 2,000 miles in covered wagons, drawn by promises of free land and mild climate, the Donation Land Act offering 640 acres to married couples willing to settle. They cut the old-growth forests, shipped the lumber to San Francisco to build that city\'s boom, dredged the Willamette to make it navigable, platted streets in a grid that ignored the hills and the river\'s curve.',

The merchant class built mansions in the West Hills, looking down on the working-class neighborhoods in Albina and St. Johns, the city stratified by elevation and proximity to industry.',

The workers came from the South and the Midwest, Black workers drawn by jobs that paid well and promises of opportunity, discovering that Oregon\'s racism was different than Mississippi\'s but still effective. Vanport, a hastily built housing project for shipyard workers, flooded in 1948 when a dike failed, destroying the city\'s largest Black community overnight, displacing 18,000 people, most of whom never returned, the flood used as excuse to dismantle what white Portland had always considered temporary.',

But the city stopped the Mount Hood Freeway in the 1970s, citizens organizing to prevent another highway through Southeast Portland, using the federal money instead to build the light rail system that now defines the city\'s self-image as progressive and environmentally conscious.',

The population swelled with young people drawn by Powell\'s Books and microbreweries and the promise that you could live creatively without wealth, that Portland was the place where slackers and artists could still afford rent.
