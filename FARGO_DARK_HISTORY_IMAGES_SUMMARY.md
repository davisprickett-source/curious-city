Following the Minneapolis Klein Brothers approach:
- ✅ Prioritized authentic photos from government archives (USGS, C-SPAN)
- ✅ Used historical context photos where direct crime scene photos aren't available/appropriate
- ✅ All images are public domain or free-to-use with proper attribution
- ✅ Quality over quantity - each image adds historical context

## Quality Standards Met

- All images have descriptive, historically accurate alt text
- All images have proper attribution/credits
- All images are legally sourced (public domain or free-use licenses)
- Images enhance understanding of the historical context

## Key Findings During Research
1. **Billy Wolf Case (1978)**: Active cold case with podcast coverage; USGS had excellent Red River photos
2. **Adolph Martel Case (1941)**: Obscure case with limited photo documentation; used representative hospital images
3. **Larry Phebus Case (1963)**: Oldest cold case in ND AG's office; prairie landscape captures the isolation
4. **Wells Fargo Scandal (2016)**: Extensive Congressional testimony footage available via C-SPAN
