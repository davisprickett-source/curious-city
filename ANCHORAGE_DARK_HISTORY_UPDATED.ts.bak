      body: 'Alaska has the highest rate of serial killings per capita in the nation—15.65 per million inhabitants. The vastness of the wilderness, sparse law enforcement, transient population, and months of darkness create conditions where predators thrive and victims vanish. Anchorage, as the state\'s largest city, has been home to some of America\'s most methodical killers.',
      verdict: 'A pattern of violence enabled by isolation, transience, and inadequate law enforcement resources.',

      body: 'Robert Hansen, a respected Anchorage baker and family man, kidnapped, raped, and murdered at least 17 women over twelve years. His method was horrifyingly recreational: he would fly victims in his private plane to remote wilderness locations, release them, and hunt them like game with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle. Most victims were dancers and sex workers from Fourth Avenue clubs—women Hansen believed nobody would miss. Only 12 bodies have ever been recovered.',

"Horseshoe Harriet," another victim, was finally identified in 2022 through DNA genealogy as Robin Pelkey. Other victims may never be identified.

Living in Anchorage, he buried "murder kits" (weapons, cash, body disposal equipment) in locations from Alaska to New York, traveling thousands of miles to commit crimes that couldn\'t be connected. He had no victim type, killed for pleasure, studied forensics to avoid detection. His capture came in 2012 after abducting 18-year-old Samantha Koenig from a Tudor Road coffee stand.',

One club logged 207 police calls between 1977 and 1982: rape, weapons, prostitution, murder. The women who worked there were seen as expendable. When they disappeared, investigations stalled.',
