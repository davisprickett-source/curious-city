5. **Stock/generic**: Replace with venue-specific when possible

### Permission Requirements:
- Official website/press kit images: Generally okay with attribution
- Editorial published photos: Check publication's image licensing
- Instagram photos: Request permission from account holder
- User-generated: Always request permission and credit photographer
- Wikimedia Commons: Follow specific license requirements (CC-BY-SA, etc.)

4. Hai Hai - contact for food photography, check Squarespace site
5. Eat Street - photograph corridor, individual restaurants
6. Matchbox Coffee - check Instagram, contact for official photos

### Phase 2: Diversify Single-Source Establishments
1. Moto-i - add official photos to Mpls.St.Paul Magazine coverage
2. Grumpy's Northeast - mix Caitlin Abrams photos with Instagram content
3. Dogwood Coffee - add official photos to Sprudge coverage

### Phase 3: Replace Generic Images

3. Al's Breakfast - replace Wikimedia generic with Al's-specific images

### Phase 4: Quality Enhancement
