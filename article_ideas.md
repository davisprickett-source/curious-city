# Curious City Article Ideas

## Priority Articles (One Per City Before Ship)

### Minneapolis: Duck Duck Grey Duck
**THE #1 PICK** - Minnesota is the only place in America that plays "Duck Duck Grey Duck" instead of "Duck Duck Goose." Every other state. Every other country that plays the game. They all say "Goose." Minnesotans will defend this to the death and insist they're right. The history goes back to Swedish immigrant games, but the real story is about regional identity, stubborn persistence, and the joy of being weird. This is the quintessential "local would absolutely love to read this" article.

### Chicago: The Eastland Disaster
**THE FORGOTTEN TRAGEDY** - On July 24, 1915, the SS Eastland rolled over while still tied to the dock on the Chicago River, killing 844 people headed to a company picnic. More deaths than the Titanic. The ship never left the wharf. Passengers were trapped between decks 20 feet from shore. It remains the deadliest single-vessel disaster in Great Lakes history, yet nobody makes movies about it. A story about tragedy, geography, and which disasters get remembered.

### Raleigh: The Village Underground
**PUNK ROCK IN A BOMB SHELTER** - Beneath The Fresh Market in the Village District lies a sealed 20,000-square-foot Cold War bomb shelter that hosted The Ramones, Iggy Pop, The Police, Sonic Youth, Pat Benatar, Steve Martin, and George Carlin between 1971-1984. The entrance was designed to look like a NYC subway station. David Sedaris remembers it from his Raleigh high school days. Now sealed, your organic kale sits directly above where punk happened.

### Denver: Blucifer - The Demon Horse That Murdered Its Creator
**ART IS DANGEROUS** - The 32-foot blue mustang sculpture at Denver International Airport has glowing red eyes and killed the artist who made it. In 2006, a piece of the sculpture fell on creator Luis Jiménez and severed an artery in his leg. He died. The horse was completed by his family and installed in 2008. Locals call it "Blucifer." The airport also sells conspiracy theory merch about itself. Denver is weird.

### Seattle: D.B. Cooper - America's Only Unsolved Hijacking
**THE MAN WHO VANISHED** - On November 24, 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked a plane, collected $200,000, and parachuted into the night over Washington state. He was never found. In 1980, a boy found $5,800 of the ransom money on the Columbia River - the only physical evidence ever recovered. The FBI suspended the case in 2016. It remains America's only unsolved hijacking and the Pacific Northwest's greatest mystery.

### Portland: The Vanport Flood - A City Erased in 35 Minutes
**DISASTER AND DISPLACEMENT** - Vanport was Oregon's second-largest city by 1948, home to 18,500 people including most of Portland's Black population. On May 30, 1948, a railroad dike failed. Officials had assured residents there was no danger. The city went underwater in 35 minutes. Vanport was never rebuilt. Today it's Delta Park - parking lots and soccer fields where a city used to be. The flood permanently reshaped Portland's demographics for generations.

### Phoenix: The Phoenix Lights - Mass UFO Sighting
**THOUSANDS OF WITNESSES** - On March 13, 1997, thousands of Arizona residents witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the sky. The formation was described as a mile wide, blocking out stars. Witnesses included pilots, police officers, and the Governor. The Air Force claimed flares. Witnesses say that doesn't explain what they saw. It remains one of the most witnessed and documented UFO events in history.

### Anchorage: The Good Friday Earthquake - 9.2 Magnitude
**THE GROUND LIQUEFIED** - On March 27, 1964, the most powerful earthquake in North American history shook Anchorage for four and a half minutes. The ground didn't just crack - it liquefied. Entire neighborhoods slid into Cook Inlet. Fourth Avenue dropped 11 feet. 75 homes were swallowed in what is now Earthquake Park. You can still walk through the land that ate a neighborhood.

### Dallas: The Integrated Circuit - Foundation of Modern Technology
**DALLAS INVENTED YOUR PHONE** - The integrated circuit - the foundation of all modern computing - was invented in Dallas by Texas Instruments engineer Jack Kilby in 1958. This invention made computers, smartphones, and every piece of modern electronics possible. Kilby won the Nobel Prize in 2000. Every electronic device you use traces back to a North Dallas lab. The entire digital age was born here.

### Colorado Springs: Tesla's Lightning Lab
**MAD SCIENTIST GOES DARK** - In 1899, Nikola Tesla built an 80-foot lightning machine in Colorado Springs. His experiments generated 135-foot artificial lightning bolts - so powerful they fried the city's generator and plunged Colorado Springs into total darkness. He claimed he received radio signals from Mars. The site of his laboratory is now a parking lot with a small plaque that vastly undersells the chaos.

### Fargo: On the Bed of a Vanished Sea
**APOCALYPTIC GEOLOGY** - That perfectly flat horizon in Fargo? It's the silted floor of glacial Lake Agassiz, which covered 110,000 square miles 10,000 years ago - larger than all five Great Lakes combined. When the ice dam broke, it drained catastrophically into the ocean, possibly triggering a global cooling event. The Red River flows north because of this ancient lake bed, which is why spring floods are catastrophic. The flatness isn't boring. It's apocalyptic.

- **The Portland Vice Scandal (1912-1913)**: A massive police crackdown on Portland's gay community led to mass arrests, public trials, and national headlines. The scandal directly contributed to Oregon's passage of eugenics laws. A dark chapter in LGBTQ+ history rarely discussed.
